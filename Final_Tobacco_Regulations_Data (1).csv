0,FDA-2012-D-0071-0272,If people are stupid enough to smoke then let them do that. Don't force helpless animals to smoke. This is so cruel and whoever are doing this I would like to have it done to them. Shame on you!
1,FDA-2012-D-0071-0391,We know what tobacco does already....this is sheer stupidity and ignorance. Take this money and help the animals or elderly or disabled. What is going on in this world?

3,FDA-2009-N-0294-0059,I believe this product needs to be banned altogether. I have inlaws that are in very poor health and are so hooked on tobacco that even after major surgery for both of them they still refuse to quit. Part of their health issues are due to prolonged tobacco use. Individuals who use tobacco products should be required to pay higher medical premiums instead of everyone baring the cost. A product that causes this much damage should be eliminated.
4,FDA-2012-D-0071-0243,"Please do not allow language that encourages or allows new animal testing for the Tobacco association. Animal testing is not needed. Animals develop different diseases  than humans do, have different reactions to tobacco smoke than humans do. Additionally shoving rats in tubes and having concentrated smoke blown in their face is a horrible way to test the side effects of tobacco, it doesn't seem to be related to how humans inhale tobacco smoke at all. Please encourage the Tobacco industry to find alternative, humane methods of testing their products. "

Some experiments are lethal; the subjects of others live to see another day — and another experiment. Much of this research is not only cruel; it is useless and even silly.

20,FDA-2009-N-0294-0281,"With many states receiving funds from tobacco companies I think it's time to have the states dedicate these funds to at least the CDC minimum to tobacco control programs that are proven to work. The FDA should meet with the states and see if some kind of solution can be worked out regarding this funding issue. Massachusetts as an example received $844 million in FY09 in tobacco funds from taxes and the Master Settlement but only gave $5 million to tobacco control for the whole state for FY10, less than one percent! The FDA has to look at why money that should be going to programs that help people go to fund state projects that have nothing to do with tobacco. The FDA also must look at why cigars and blunt wraps are not taxed like other tobacco considering with the increase in prices and the various flavors it's one of the cheapest ways to smoke. Cheap prices and various flavors equals an almost automatic attraction to children who might otherwise not be attracted to a traditional cigarettes or cigars. If the FDA had cigars and blunt wraps designated how they should be which is a tobacco product just like cigarettes and taxed as such the number of children who will try these products would drop dramatically."

22,TTB-2010-0004-0144,"I am responding to the news that there may be a hike in the price of pipe tobacco. This is another outrageous overage in taxiation by our government being perpatrated against the smokers of this country. The cost of cigarettes in general, for some brands, has already tripled in less then two years. Now you want to talk about raising costs again against another form of tobacco? If this is done I truly believe there will be a lot of politicians out of work. We are tired of being treated as criminals and having the burden of taxation lying on our doorstep. We will all come together either sooner or later to fight against this taking place. There are enough true luxery items out in the world to lay this burden on. How about the government stop spending so much and doing away with the taxes?  DO NOT raise taxes!"

29,TTB-2010-0004-0076,"Rather than continuing to increase the tax burden on the American people, and to continually attack our personal freedoms, why not cut some of the more un-necessary and, frankly, ridiculous programs which Americans are currently being forced to pay for, whether we want these programs or not.It is a well-documented fact that increasing taxes provides less overall income to the federal government. It is also well-documented fact that descreasing taxes not only improves the country's morale, but encourages business owners to invest in more employees, more equipment, and again, is proven to provide a greater amount of tax revenue to the federal government.There are currently far too many un-necessary and unproductive programs in place. Eliminating these programs would not only increase the money available for more sensible programs, but would show our Nations creditors that we are serious about eliminating our Nations un-sustainable debt.Another money saving tactic (which would also increase the goodwill between government and the American people) would be eliminate the insulting pay raises that government is constantly approving for itself - raising their own salaries at a time when it cannot be afforded and while the American people are suffering.The answer for our Nations debt is fiscal responsibility - not applying further business and morale damaging regulations and taxes.The American people are required to live within our means - it is high time that the American Government do the same."
32,FDA-2009-N-0294-0181,"I'm writing to state that the FDA regulation of tobacco is a great step forward in protecting children and future generations, from Big Tobacco. I look forward to your agency vigorously  tackling this responsibility with vigor.I am also writing to urge you to enforce the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in a way that lays the groundwork for full, constructive U.S. participation in the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). As you know, the U.S. is one of the few remaining countries that have not ratified this treaty, so our citizens are not yet protected by its life-saving measures.You will need to be vigilant, as there is one glaring inconsistency between this new law and the global tobacco treaty. Because Big Tobacco has a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict of interest with public health, the treaty safeguards health policy against tobacco industry interference.Unfortunately, this new legislation gives the tobacco industry a seat at the table in setting FDA policies. Including industry representatives on the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee is akin to letting the fox guard the henhouse. The tobacco corporations will seek to exploit this loophole, just as they are trying to get governments around the world to ignore their obligations under the FCTC.I urge you to resist and bring to light any attempts by the tobacco industry to undermine FDA regulation. Along with other members of Corporate Accountability International, I will be closely following the exercise of your new authority, and thank you in advance for your work to protect our kids from Big Tobacco's dirty tricks and predatory marketing.Sincerely,(your name)"

37,FDA-2009-N-0294-0381,"To Whom it May Concern:As a concerned anti-tobacco public health advocate I would like to encourage FDA leaders to take the proper and totally appropriate steps to assert jurisdiction/authority over cigars, little cigars, pipes, hookah, and other tobacco products--as these are still harmful and increasingly marketed to/and used by teens and children, young adults.  I also feel strongly that FDA take the CDC's OSH's suggestion without delay to exercise authority over mentholated cigarettes, which have historically been strongly marketed to African Americans specifically (as well as Hispanic/Latino populations), to keep them addicted. This is an example of despicable industry manipulation and deceit, which is nothing less than black discrimination in its most ugly form. If we care about unfair marketing practices to our youth and children, shouldn't we also care about unfair marketing practices targeting our disparate populations and their future? In addition I urge FDA to maintain the strength of the legislation by fighting for the provision of no tobacco products advertising within 1000 ft (at least 500ft) of schools, playgrounds, or parks.  Finally, I express my disappointment that non-voting executives from Phillip Morris are sitting on the scientific advisory committee.  This seems to me such a breach of confidence and so wrong to the people of the United States that this historically, deceitful tobacco industry would be admitted this completely inappropriate privilege.  What other industry in fairness has been offered the same inappropriate privilege while they are being regulated? It leads me to have the deepest doubt that the FDA regulation efforts will ever come to any significant good, and makes it very  hard for me to feel any confidence or trust in any real strength of this regulation. I hope public and government outcry to this breach of confidence, will reverse the ability for PM to stay on.Why was this privilege extended to PM and not others?"

48,FDA-2009-N-0294-0054,"The public is becoming aware that nicotine has many major health benefits despite the fact that public health officials say otherwise.  There is nicotine in potatoes, tomatoes, cauliflower, broccoli, and many other foods.  It is simply not true the claims of death from second hand smoke, nor has any death ever been truly attributed to smoking.  This is a fallacy brought about by the massive amounts of money spent by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a major shareholder of Johnson & Johnson, makers of smoking cessation products, Nicoderm and Nicorette.  These two products are responsible for a plethora of adverse health complications and should never have been put on the market!  This does not give the FDA much credibility, to say the least.  The FDA MUST become accountable factually to the public instead of acting on behalf of big pharma and governmental lobbyists!  Smokers have become the latest minority group discriminated against, much like black people once were by socially engineered propoganda and lies.  There is absolutely NO evidence other than the paid for meta-analysis studies put forth by those with a profit to be made pushing their own nicotine products.  The public is bombarded with advertisements for things they can't even get without asking a doctor for, and physicians are getting quite fed up with this also.  The pharmaceutical companies say these ads are educational, I say they are intrusive.  This is the industry that the FDA needs to further regulate, not the freedom of individuals to choose a product like tobacco that's been around for centuries!"

I use one, and have not lit a tobacco cigarette since Jan of 2009.  If I am unable to obtain kits or parts by mail, I will be in big trouble health-wise because there are no locations I know of within at least 100 miles of my residence in Calaveras County, CA. that even sell e-cigs.Online retailers make every effort to be sure they do not sell to minors. Just the fact that a credit card is required for purchase prevents most minors from purchasing e-cigs because most minors do not have credit cards, and if they do, they have to answer to their parents about each and every charge they make.I am disabled.  I do not want to smoke another cigarette. Ever.  If I cannot purchase online, I will have to try patches or gum, which have not worked for me in the past, and I fear I would end up purchasing cigarettes.  Please do not put me in the position of having to give up nicotine, which helps my brain to function, or go back to smoking.I beg you to continue to allow the online purchase of e-cig kits and parts so I can stay off tobacco cigarettes.I also fear this could create a black market, which is not your intent.Many people who use e-cigs are disabled and unable to travel long distances to obtain their e-cigs.Studies have show that very few minors use e-cigs because of the initial cost outlay and the hassles of maintenance.  The majority of e-cig users are over 30.Please keep e-cigs available by internet or mail order for the thousands (if not millions, by now) of e-cig users.Respectfully submitted,"

Human population studies, clinical intervention trials, and human-based cellular studies should remain the foundation of tobacco research rather than animal studies.Animal studies were initially used to deny the smoking-lung cancer link. But decades of human epidemiology studies prove this link and other devastating effects tobacco has on human health. The Institute of Medicine says that it is not possible to make laboratory animals use tobacco products the way humans do, and there are inherent interspecies differences that prevent meaningful extrapolation of effects to humans.The self-addiction studies that FDA recommends be performed in animals, such as “place preference,” “drug discrimination,” and “self-administration” studies, are not only cruel, but tenuously linked to human behavior."

There is so much valuable truthful facts and information available and to date no real data that scientifically proves that e-cigarettes are a danger.  They are a modern miracle, like so many advances in so many areas we have come to appreciate in just under 200 years on the planet earth.

Addiction is not a crime and nicotine is by far the least dangerous of all drugs, it is on par with caffeine according to scientific studies.  Some studies are pointing to scientifically proven health benefits from nicotine.

130,FDA-2013-N-0521-0465,"November 6, 2013To the Center for Tobacco Products:We, the members of the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment’s Tobacco Review Committee, are writing to strongly advise the FDA Center for Tobacco Products to exercise its regulatory authority and ban the use of menthol in all tobacco products. Menthol is an anesthetic which numbs the mouth and throat and allows people to more comfortably inhale the burning acrid toxic smoke from cigarettes. The mint flavor also covers up the unappealing flavor of natural tobacco. Menthol is also used in other tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco, to make ingestion more palatable; this encourages use, and eventually, addiction to nicotine.Menthol disproportionally affects young and disadvantaged populations. Teenagers in particular are more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes, and when they do, they are more likely to become regular smokers. Menthol cigarettes are also used more frequently in socio-economically disadvantaged populations, and cigarettes containing menthol are associated with a decreased cessation success. African-Americans use menthol cigarettes more often than those of other races/ethnicities, and, in fact, according to a recent article in the American Journal of Public Health (Winickoff, 2011), African-Americans overwhelmingly support a ban on menthol in cigarettes. Tobacco companies are encouraging their constituents to argue that banning menthol would cost states financially in cigarette tax revenue. As a group whose mission relies on state tobacco tax dollars to fund the programs that we review, we would gladly accept a smaller pool of funds if that meant fewer smokers in Colorado, and a healthier public. In addition, the cost of lower tax revenue and increased enforcement will most likely be offset by the savings to the state in healthcare and other tobacco-related costs.Banning menthol in tobacco products will help us by:-Reducing adolescent smoking initiation-Decreasing smoking among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations-Increasing the rate of smoking cessation among African-Americans-Reducing the overall smoking rate in the State of Colorado-Reducing tobacco-related death and disease for all ColoradansPlease take this opportunity to provide strong leadership in the regulation of tobacco products by banning menthol in all tobacco products.Sincerely,Karen Wilson, MD, MPHChildren’s Hospital ColoradoStatewide Tobacco Control NonprofitReview Committee ChairPamela Talley, MDWardenburg Health Center at CUFamily Physician AssociationReview Committee Vice-ChairJoseph Craig, MDColorado Permanente Medical GroupStatewide Physician AssociationReview Committee MemberKathy James, PhD, MSCEColorado School of Public HealthUniversity of Colorado/EvaluationReview Committee MemberKathleen Patrick, RN, MAColorado Department of EducationReview Committee MemberJennifer LudwigEagle County Public HealthLocal Public Health AgenciesReview Committee MemberDaniel Kortsch, MDDenver Health and HospitalsDisadvantaged PopulationsReview Committee MemberDave YoungState House of RepresentativesReview Committee Member"

The liquid, the way I understand it, is fairly non toxic. Of course, not putting it in your eye and using common sense. These products are NOT for kids, and I agree they should not be sold to minors. But in the adult world it is a much better option. I would ask you to leave this industry be as it is. So many things are heavily regulated these days and I understand the compliance issues.

170,FDA-2013-N-0521-0086,"Dear Food and Drug Administration:As the Supervisor for District 8 in San Francisco, California, I represent a large segment of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community in our city.  I am very concerned about any health threats that have a major impact on the citizens I serve.Data shows that the LGBT community smokes significantly more than the general population.  For example, recent data in California shows that LGBT individuals smoke twice as much as all others in our state.  There is also evidence that our community smokes menthol at a high rate as well.  A 2010 report from the National Youth Advocacy Coalition (NYAC) found that 71% of the LGBT young adults between 18 and 24 years of age surveyed smoked menthol.  This is consistent with the results of the FDA’s recent report that indicates a higher rate of menthol smoking among other minorities that face discrimination. As the FDA’s own research also concluded, menthol increases the likelihood that youth and young adults will start smoking, become more heavily addicted to nicotine, and have a more difficult time quitting.Banning the use of menthol flavoring in tobacco products would help everyone, but it would have the largest impact on segments of the population, such as the LGBT community, that already smokes more and uses menthol products at a higher rate than others.I support a ban on the use of menthol in tobacco products be adopted.Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely,Scott WienerSan Francisco Supervisor, District 8"

173,FDA-2011-N-0467-0013,"Regulating non face to face sales of tobacco products should not be allowed. The real consumer of mail order tobacco is primarly individuals who cannot receive certain brands at their local store. Secondly, it allows for consumers to have home delivery and better pricing.By restricting tobacco purchases to only face to face transactions your are limiting consumers who cannot go to a local store to purchase and limiting them to purchasing brands that are only found in their market.This would not prevent children from purchasing tobacco.Most children do not have credit cards therefore they cant purchase on line. The few children who do purchase tobacco,less than 5% are purchasing cigarrettes not cigars.And of those who are purchasing are doing so locally and paying in cash not online and not via credit card. As one cannot purchase cigarettes online.The reality is this will not do anything to curb underage tobacco use as its targeting the wrong kind of tobacco use.It will also create more work for the FDA and compliance for companies to follow. In the end it will kill a golden goose for the government that lookst at this industry as a highly taxed revenue generator. There is such a thing as killing the goose all together."
175,FDA-2013-N-0521-0381,"Department of Health and Human Services – Food and Drug AdministrationDocket No. FDA–2013–N–0521Dear Mr. Mitchell Zeller:I am writing to comment on the Food and Drug Administration proposed rule on menthol cigarettes.  First, I would like to commend the Agency for its consideration of the public health in this matter.  By expanding the scope of tobacco flavorings impacted by regulations flowing from the 2009 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Agency has the potential to both protect human health and ward off a potential trade dispute, as will be discussed below.  By taking proper measures against menthol in cigarettes, the FDA will save the United States taxpayer money.As I am sure the Agency is aware, any limitations on menthol in cigarettes will need to be compliant with international trade rules and norms.  Soon after the FDA banned other flavors of cigarettes (including fruit and clove flavors) in 2009, Indonesia, as a major exporter of the cloves used to make clove cigarettes, brought the U.S. – Clove Cigarettes (Appellate Body report: WT/DS406/AB/R, 4 April 2012) dispute before the World Trade Organization (WTO).  When the WTO Appellate Body decided that menthol and clove cigarettes qualified as “like products” under Article 2.1 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade, which was part of Indonesia’s argument that the United States was giving preferential treatment in trade regulations to its own menthol product, the United States lost the U.S. – Clove Cigarettes case.  If the United States does not take sufficient action towards banning menthol flavoring in cigarettes (thus showing that it is not treating the menthol flavoring any differently from clove flavoring), it is likely that Indonesia will pursue trade remedies against the US.  In fact, as of August 23, Indonesia has requested authorization to retaliate against the United States in this matter.Accordingly, in addition to attempting to maximize public health benefits by weighing the considerations contemplated in the FDA’s Scientific Evaluation, the Agency should also consider trade implications.  Since the Agency enacted an outright ban against clove cigarettes in 2009, it seems unlikely that anything much less than a ban or graduated ban on menthol in cigarettes would satisfy U.S. trade obligations to the WTO and Indonesia following the U.S. –Clove Cigarettes case.  A tobacco product standard for menthol in cigarettes which still allows a certain amount of menthol or any similar flavoring to be added to cigarettes would not go far enough, at least as long as the WTO is concerned.   Therefore, I strongly recommend that the FDA consider banning menthol flavoring in cigarettes outright.  Sincerely,Kate ScherschelJ.D. CandidateStanford Law School"

The problem is the marketing, and the flavors. The liquid that comes in flavor that are going to appeal to children. flavors like Bubble Gum, or Cotton Candy, and the colors that these products come in are bright, and would more than likely catch the eye of a small child, Currently there is currently no federal requirement that liquid nicotine containers have child-resistant packaging. History has shown us that one of the best ways to prevent a child from accessing a product that they should not be accessing is to create child resistant packaging.

But decades of human epidemiology studies prove this link and other devastating effects tobacco has on human health.The Institute of Medicine says that it is not possible to make laboratory animals use tobacco products the way humans do, and there are inherent interspecies differences that prevent meaningful extrapolation of effects to humans.The self-addiction studies that FDA recommends be performed in animals, such as “place preference,” “drug discrimination,” and “self-administration” studies, are not only cruel, but tenuously linked to human behavior.Tobacco is inherently hazardous and poses serious risks to the user’s health and to the health of others.

Thankfully, I had the good sense never to do that.  I can't however avoid everyone else that smokes, secondhand smoke is even more dangerous.  I am seeing smoking in movies and all over television now.  It absolutely makes me sick!  They are advertising to children.  What happened to the ban on smoking in tv, movies, and commercializing it?  I am sick of trying to go into a store holding my breath so that I don't have to breathe it.  I want clean air!  I see people dying from it with emphezema and lung cancer.  They still smoke sometimes because it is so addicting.  I see people smoking with their children right behind them, and worse yet pregnant mothers.  It's not right that the tabacco industry gets away with all they are doing to promote it.  Most people who smoke, started before they were age 18.  They should quit targetting children.

239,FDA-2013-N-0521-0423,"For the past 15+ years I have been the Project Manager of the ATOD Network for Tobacco Dependence Treatment and Cessation, a county-wide clinical training program, located at Thunder Road Adolescent Treatment program in Oakland, CA. During this time we have focused our efforts on training clinicians how to treat tobacco dependence in safety net community serving clinics and with behavioral health providers who serve the most high risk, high-use consumers of mental health and substance abuse services. These populations continue to smoke at much higher rates than the general population. Many are people of color who have been targeted by the tobacco industry for decades encouraging use of menthol cigarettes, esp. African Americans, who often suffer inordinately higher consequences of tobacco related disease and death, and are also among the highest users of mentholated tobacco products.... starting with teens and continuing through a lifetime of smoking. Research tells us that because the menthol flavoring in cigarettes allows for deeper inhalation and absorption of high levels of nicotine, those who smoke mentholated cigarettes have a harder time quitting. This is certainly born out in our work.  Over these years we continue to see that those who smoke menthol cigarettes tend to hang on to their addiction, and seem less able and/or willing to quit. When asked if menthol was banned from cigarettes, would they continue to smoke. Most say NO; they would quit. This attests to the power of this flavoring to keep people hooked on smoking, and by consequence more at risk for dying of tobacco-related disease. We also see menthol as the 'gateway'  tobacco flavoring preferred by youth who find it easier to endure the physical discomforts of smoking because menthol masks the throat and lung irritation, and allows more nicotine to reach the brain centers, thus creating addiction after smoking only a few cigarettes. Menthol flavored tobacco products is a sinister, manipulative way to recruit and hook young smokers. The tobacco industry depends on this. I'm writing to express my most earnest request that the FDA, do the right thing, and BAN menthol in tobacco products as a way to protect the public health and eliminate these tobacco products that are so detrimental to those who use them. Respectfully,Judy Gerard"
241,FDA-2013-N-0521-0200,"Re:  Docket No. FDA-2013-N-0521To Whom It May Concern:As you know, the tobacco industry is heavily regulated.  Many of the regulations are effective and need to be in place.  Others are not.  On behalf of the Board of Directors and members of the Oklahoma Wholesale Marketers Association, I am responding to your request for public comment and information regarding menthol in cigarettes.The Oklahoma Wholesale Marketers Association is a statewide trade association that has represented the wholesale distributors of Oklahoma for over 70 years.  A large percentage of the member wholesale houses are small, family-owned businesses serving their own and neighboring communities in Oklahoma and surrounding states. Tobacco distributors affix the tax stamps purchased from the state to the packages of cigarettes and other tobacco products we sell to the retailer.We are trying to combat contraband product sales here in Oklahoma and have worked with our state regulatory agency to attempt to control the influx of untaxed moist tobacco into Oklahoma.  Our association can see another contraband/counterfeit problem with menthol cigarettes in the future if the FDA restricts access to menthol cigarettes or completely bans them.  Banning menthol cigarettes would hurt manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers.  Please consider this when you make your final decision on the sale of menthol cigarettes.

243,FDA-2009-N-0294-0028,"In terms of the best approach for decreasing prevalence, adult smoking cessation produces substantial results.  There is an urgent need to increase cessation attempts and efficacious evidence based methods have been well documented.  The problem is that cessation intervention by health care practitioners has not yet become the norm.  The FDA is now in a unique position to play a role in supporting cessation intervention by health care providers as well as cessation efforts by tobacco users.  The FDA should do all within its power to ensure that all health care professionals are educated about how to incorporate cessation intervention into practice no matter the specialty and that systematic cessation intervention is offered in all health care facilities no matter the size as the 2008 US Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence Guideline stipulates.  Knowing how to help smokers quit is not the issue – the disconnect is that this knowledge is not being put into action.  The FDA should advocate that the health care culture incorporate cessation intervention into practice as has been promoted for over 20 years and encourage all tobacco users to seek quit assistance (only 1 in 4 smokers try an over-the-counter cessation medication and fewer than that ask for help).  I have a very successful practice and would be glad to assist with these efforts in any way possible.As a nurse who has specialized in Tobacco Cessation Treatment for almost 25 years, I must admit my extreme discomfort and disappointment with the FDA Tobacco “regulation”.  Genuine FDA oversight is the best option for reducing the 400,000 deaths each year attributed to tobacco use.   However, bona fide oversight for this product does not equate to regulation – it should result in elimination.  The fact that Phillip Morris was at the table regarding FDA regulation of a product with over 4000 chemicals including 43 known carcinogens only taints the FDA.  As an agency committed to public health and safety, the focus must be on eliminating the tobacco epidemic by ensuring eradication of all tobacco products!  Since that is not a reality, making cessation a priority would have a tremendous impact on prevalence and it is essential that the FDA emphatically supports cessation intervention finally becoming a precedence in our health care system by at the very least adhering to the US Tobacco Use Guideline."

Along that time several dozen attempts to quit were failed. Until I picked up my first vape pen when they came out. An ego pen. It was my first successful attempt to quit. I quit for more than six months. Unfortunately I started back on cigarettes. again for about a year until but with my vape I didnt smoke nearly as much. When the first larger devices came out and more flavor option were available is when I quit smoking for good. After vaping the dessert and fruit flavors for a week I couldnt stand the taste of cigarettes and wanted nothing to do with cigarettes. Im still vaping and feel better than ever being off cigarettes. I enjoy my fruit and dessert flavors its the only thing keeping me off the deadly cigarettes. I believe that the companies should tone down their labels to not look like kids food labels. Theres other ways to attract adults and still be safe. We need to be more conscious of kids being attracted to the packaging.

Thereby the established non-fermentation heat treatment character of the method was retained, and certain quality improvements of the heat treatment process were introduced. The manufacturing process became completely closed to eliminate any contamination, and the temperature during the heat treatment process was raised. Further steps of quality development were taken and then formalized in the Gothiatek standard.

295,FDA-2012-D-0071-1469,"Regarding MRTP testing on animals.I am a physician deeply concerned about the public health consequences of this guidance.Human population studies, clinical intervention trials, and human-based cellular studies should remain the foundation of tobacco research.Animal studies were initially used to deny the smoking-lung cancer link. But decades of human epidemiology studies prove this link and other devastating effects tobacco has on human health.The Institute of Medicine says that it is not possible to make laboratory animals use tobacco products the way humans do, and there are inherent interspecies differences that prevent meaningful extrapolation of effects to humans.The self-addiction studies that FDA recommends be performed in animals, such as “place preference,” “drug discrimination,” and “self-administration” studies, are not only cruel, but tenuously linked to human behavior.Tobacco is inherently hazardous and poses serious risks to the user’s health and to the health of others. Testing more cigarettes, additives, and other tobacco products on animals will not protect public health.There are millions of humans who smoke and would probably happily test MRTP's in exchange for free cigarettes or other compensation. It is not necessary or even informative to involve animals in these tests.Michele Johnson, M.D."

297,FDA-2013-N-0521-0050,"Menthol should be removed as a flavoring in all tobacco products.  Menthol provides cooling and anesthetic properties that reduce the harsh qualities of tobacco, making it easier for youth experimenting with cigarettes to adjust to the taste of tobacco, thus facilitating regular smoking.  In New York State, more established youth smokers smoke Newport (37%), a menthol cigarette, than any other brand.  Marlboro is the second most popular choice, at a distant 23%. I agree with the American Public Health Association that menthol cigarettes lure young smokers to start smoking, and once addicted, make it harder for them to quit, thus posing a significant public health threat.  Despite decreases in both adult and youth smoking rates, tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death in this country. Tobacco is a unique product, killing one-half of its long term users. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA) provides an opportunity for government to impose regulations to protect young Americans from addiction to this deadly product at an impressionable age.  The FDA should welcome this opportunity and eliminate menthol as a tobacco flavoring, thus saving thousands of lives."

However, I believe that unreasonable regulations, including a ban, would result in significant unintended effects. A ban of menthol in cigarettes by the FDA would greatly expand the illicit trade market, reduce state revenues, and put many of my constituents out of work.If menthol in cigarettes were banned, based on past experience, our state would be forced to shoulder the enforcement burden to prevent illicit tobacco trade. This large-scale, state-funded enforcement effort would likely take additional state resources and dilute the efforts of our law enforcement officials to protect the welfare of the citizens of Michigan. And, if counterfeit contraband cigarettes begin flooding an otherwise legal cigarette marketplace here in Michigan, significant harmful public health effects could arise because many of these products contain unregulated ingredients and are manufactured in unregulated overseas countries. This has been well documented by many federal and state agencies and will add to the pressures already placed on our overburdened criminal justice system.I encourage FDA to take science-based actions to address the public health impact from smoking. However, your actions have real economic and enforcement consequences to our state. To that end, I strongly urge you not to take any negative actions on menthol cigarettes that are counterproductive and adversely affect our state.Sincerely,Frank D. FosterState Representative"

If the FDA desires to base its regulatory decisions on scientific evidence (as the agency has repeatedly claimed), it would not only downplay this counterproductive Congressional mandate, but the agency would also truthfully inform tobacco consumers of these vitally important facts.Otherwise, many smokers, smokeless tobacco users and others will continue to inaccurately believe that reducing some harmful constituents in tobacco smoke (as occured with low tar, light and ultralight cigarettes) reduces the health risks of cigarettes, and that smokeless tobacco products pose far greater health risks than the epidemiolgoical evidence has consistently found.

It is the Common belief that the Sole Purpose behind the FDA attempting to Ban Them is that it will cost the FDA and PHARMA untold Billions of Dollars in revenue that they get from the Drugs They Push Through without proper testing. Placing any Tobacco Label on a product that is not Tobacco is not only Absurd it should be unlawful in every sense of the word.Rather than attempting to regulate, Tax or ban these products. Why not do WHAT YOU ARE PAID TO DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!TEST THEM PROPERLY AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!I speak as a person who smoked cigarettes for 22 1/2 years and when I began using an electronic nicotine inhaler I was able to put cigarettes down and never look back.It is clear that the FDA and Pharma have a vested interest in the sales and distribution of the drugs that they claim decrease the urge to smoke. The drugs that do this have serious and potentially deadly side effects some of which I have experienced myself. Electronic Cigarettes are designed as an alternative to Tobacco use. Chantix, Wellbutrin, Zoloft and other Mind Altering Drugs are given to patients attempting to cease tobacco use. THIS IS NOT WHAT THE DRUGS WERE INITIALLY DEVELOPED FOR, they were designed to treat Mental Illnesses such as depression, anxiety and suicidal idiations. I have never seen any reports of the FDA testing the possible side effects of these substances when given to a mentally stable individual who expresses no symptoms that the drugs were originally designed to treat.So please stop being part of the epidemic of smoking and start becoming part of the solution. Leave Electronic Cigarettes as they are, without tobacco taxes and labels until you can PROVE Through Fair Testing that they are in fact harmful given the fact that every ingredient in the liquids they use IS IN FACT Approved by the FDA.

There is a pressing need for the FDA to act on the health hazards posed by menthol in cigarettes. I believe that prohibiting menthol in cigarettes is perhaps the single most powerful measure readily available to the FDA to improve America’s health.The regulatory actions the FDA might take with respect to menthol in cigarettes can impact the use of menthol in cigarettes on public health, including use among children.  Each day 3,800 adolescents try smoking for the first time, 1,000 of whom will become addicted.  Menthol in cigarettes results in more youth initiation.The youngest smokers are the most likely to smoke menthols, with a greater proportion of middle school age smokers reporting menthol use than high school age smokers. According to national surveys, 47.7% of adolescent (age 12-17) smokers report menthol cigarette use compared to 40.8% of young adult smokers (age 18-25) and 31.5% of older adult smokers (age 26 or older).  Those are some really high percentages in adolescent and young adult smokers! Higher than the adult numbers!There is no justification for further delay in eliminating the special treatment of the most harmful of all cigarette flavor additives.  The lives of our children and young adults are being impacted by the use of tobacco products… death being one of the results. It is not fair to our kids to allow this to go on any longer.

If humans want to risk their lives to smoke cigarettes, it is their prerogative to do so.  Rats don't smoke and will never want to smoke.  Let the people who willingly pick up cigarettes be your test subjects.  This treatment of rats is absolutely horrendous.  I see very little difference between dog fighting and animal experimentation.  Animals are not ours to test out our favorite devices on.  Just because people want to smoke doesn't mean completely irrelevant animals want to participate and lose their lives for.  This is completely unacceptable. Already the tobacco companies are legally allowed to poison paying citizens, one puff at a time.  One can only imagine how horrendous their interpretation of your verbiage might be.

This historic piece of legislation will save lives by ensuring that tobacco products are subject to effective and meaningful regulation to protect public health. I urge the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make the removal from the market of all  cigarettes with a characterizing flavor like watermelon, chocolate and pineapple a top priority. Flavored cigarettes mask the harshness of the products and make them more appealing to new users, especially children. Each day, more than 1,100 kids become new, regular daily smokers.  One-third to one-half of these children will die prematurely from their addiction.  Once again, please remove all cigarettes with a characterizing flavor from the market by September 20, to ensure compliance with the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.Thank you for considering my comments as you continue to make progress in implementing this important new law.

The e-cigs like blu, n-joy etc and others owned bi big tobacco don't work for most people and they keep smoking. I believe this is the biggest advance in health since the polio vacine. The choice is simple save lives or take lives. Look at the testamonials on CASAA. Chantix kills, yet it is FDA approved. No one has died from vaping. So apparent, who is against vaping, Big pharmacy, the practically useless nicotine gum, patch, lozenges, etc.The makers of chantix, all of which are about 7% effective. Big Tobacco who own Blu, njoy, etc, who sell the cigalikes at 7-11, gas stations, Wal-mart etc, probably as effective as NRT's(7%). And then there are the States that receive Billions from the tobacco settlement which is based on current tobacco sales which is going down rapidly. Big tobacco must have competition from up and coming entrepreneurs. Vaping products must not be taxed any differently than NRT's.

Vaping was founded by the smoker, for the smoker, as a means to help people quit smoking. The minute a smoker picks up vaping is the moment the smoker has ceased smoking. Smoking kills. I was a smoker. I could not quit even after being diagnosed with advanced emphysema then given 3-6 months to live. It has been just over 24  months now since I picked up vaping as a final choice to stop smoking. I'm still here to talk about it. My family, my friends, my doctor are quite amazed how vaping extended my life thus far. The damage from years of smoking, work related chemicals and poor health are irreparable of course but my quality of life is not comparable to if I had not found vaping which helped me quit smoking. Again; there is no smoke.I would think any civilized caring educated ( based on science and facts ) people would easily understand the difference. From a health perspective it is clear and and announced world wide as a means of THR along with backing from those professionals in both health care and Tobacco Control. Now I ask the FDA; Is it really that hard to figure out how to fairly regulate and promote vaping over smoking while at the same time regulate proper safety standards to protect children? Tobacco control and the Tobacco Industry would just as soon ignore this while lobbying to have sanctions that keeps cigarettes readily available ....and legal.

PMAA member associations are represented in every state capital with the exception of Alaska.  It is our position that additional restrictions on menthol cigarettes are not justified and will have several harmful unintended consequences.It is our view that tobacco retailers are extremely conscientious in efforts to combat underage smoking.  We believe FDA and state agency inspection statistics confirm the success of retailer efforts.  Because very few youth are purchasing cigarettes from convenience stores, rather than restrict menthol,  FDA would be using resources more effectively to research how youth are obtaining cigarettes?  It is our view that adult-aged friends or family members are the predominant contributor to underage smoking.  We believe adopting new strategies to limit the casual  ( and illegal) sources of cigarettes would be far more effective than restricting menthol.Without question, restricting menthol cigarettes will contribute to the expansion of  criminal enterprises and illicit tobacco markets. Menthol cigarettes comprise a significant portion of the cigarette marketplace and that demand will be exploited by criminals.  Additional criminal activity will create a need for increased spending on law enforcement and all the related judicial processes.  While menthol restrictions will increase government operating costs, it will dramatically reduce state and federal government revenues. Two examples are Michigan and Illinois.  Both states are suffering with unemployment over 9% and decreasing government revenues.  If Menthol were banned, Michigan would lose $515 million and Illinois $397 million. These are the total menthol related revenues from both the master settlements and excise taxes.

To that end, our comments center on the area of enforcement of any regulations, specifically the rate of new rule enforcement.The cigarette industry has been in place since the mid 1800’s.  In that time it has become an economic engine in those places where cigarette production takes place and in the surrounding farms and communities where tobacco is grown.  In addition and from a packaging standpoint, it has become a key customer for suppliers of printed labels, boxes, cartons, foil innerliner, tipping paper, stretch wrap, corrugated cases, printed tipping paper and polypropylene overwrap.Since 1950 the rate of smoking among adults has gone from 44% in the 1950s to around 21-22% now.  The decline has been gradual and that’s been important.  The gradual decline has allowed suppliers of materials, in some cases, to find other markets and new sales for their products.  Had the rate of decline been precipitous it would have resulted in a more immediate reduced need for packaging materials and a resultant need to shut down packaging production equipment and the termination of employees.We think it’s reasonable, assuming new rules are enforced, to build in sufficient time for both the cigarette producers and their supply chain, so these groups have sufficient time to develop and act on alternate business plans in order to minimize economic upset, and loss of employment through the entire supply chain."

One should hope that by presenting data on harmful chemicals in tobacco products, the public would be deterred from usage. Additionally, I recommend that the FDA propose the addition of a wider variety of harmful and potentially harmful chemicals and compounds. The FDA should also propose the addition of chemicals and compounds that other National Institutes and Boards have determined as dangerous or having adverse health risks. Any chemical or component that could potentially result in adverse effects to human life, should be listed by the FDA. It is the right of the public to be aware of what they are consuming or inhaling.The FDA should implement more strict regulation in regards to tobacco products in order to deter the public from use. Currently, more than 16 million Americans are living with a disease caused by tobacco smoking. Tobacco use causes more than 7 million deaths yearly worldwide. Vaping and the use of e-cigarettes have become a world-wide trend in the past few years, as marketing suggested vaping and e-cigarettes were safer alternatives to tobacco. So far in 2019, 17 Americans have died due to vaping or e-cigarette smoking. Although e-cigarettes have been presented as a healthier option and a deterrence from tobacco use, they too contain several harmful chemicals. For example, e-cigarette flavorant has been known to cause adverse effects to the human cardiovascular system.The various additive chemicals in tobacco products need to be examined with more scrutiny. The FDA should require chemical testing in various forms of tobacco use, such as vaporized, heated, and non-heated. The toxicity of a chemical may differ between various states. The 2009 Tobacco Control Act was enacted, giving the FDA authority to regulate the tobacco industry in order to reduce tobacco use and protect the public health. The public should be educated on the adverse effects of tobacco and e-cigarette use as well as the many harmful chemicals contained in the tobacco. The additions to the published HPHC list will present the public with further data and analysis of the negative effects of tobacco use.SourcesFast Facts | Fact Sheets | Smoking & Tobacco Use | CDC.

467,FDA-2015-N-1514-0138,"I am an individual consumer, as well as the volunteer legislative director for BRAVE, a state-wide advocacy group.  Not only do I agree in principle with the concept of child-resistant packaging for all nicotine-containing products, we worked with the Missouri Legislature to achieve passage of a bill that did just that.  With that said, however, to the extent that this ANPRM relates back to the FDA's Deeming Regulation with regard to vapor products, my concern that I raised in my comment to the Deeming Regulation remains.  Specifically, I and my fellow members of BRAVE, as well as CASAA, strongly object to the deeming regulation that would effectively ban all e-cigarette products other than a handful of tobacco-company cigarette-like products.  Having significant experience with users of vapor products allows me to tell you that based on those observations,  nicotine, in the low concentrations found in e-cigarette liquid, is not very toxic.  Users of open-system e-cigarettes and, like most consumers, have had accidental exposure to the liquid (e.g., spilling it on your hands, etc.), with no ill effects. My experience is that 90%+ of nicotine containing vapor products are already sold in child-resistant packaging.  And I would expect that to reach 100% in Missouri over the next few months as that law is enacted.  In fact, I see the packaging requirements as largely moot at this point.  And the various aspects of the ANPRM may likely cause a disproportionate impact on small- and medium-sized businesses that are already trying to comply with the State requirements.Further, I would point out that I have many products in my home that pose greater accidental exposure hazard than the products in question - especially considering that the majority of nicotine-containing e-liquid I now see have less than 1% nicotine, and many have less than 1/3 of that amount, or 0.3% nicotine.Finally, I am very concerned that FDA is considering warning labels that contain information that is false or misleading, and this would make consumers less likely to trust other information from the FDA or warning labels on other products.I would suggest that FDA continue this dialogue, with stakeholders, at this early stage.  There is no need to rush to regulate at this point.Thank you."
468,FDA-2012-D-0071-1383,"I am concerned about the tests for tobacco where animals are used for the purpose of :nothing. The test that are inflicted on those animals are cruel and unnecessary as it is well known that tobacco IS bad for human health and the tests have no relevance to humans. The tests with animals should not be used anymore, they are archaic and cruel, no more animals should suffer, so I am asking you to not allow the animal testing for the product testing. It is posible to test without any animals as it happens in other countries like Belgium, Germany , the U.K. and others. It can happen because it's known that those animals do not have the same responses as the human body does, so not only is a useless and cruel test but it can't lead to progress."

So that I can sit back and laugh while non-smokers complain about how their taxes have gone up since they ban tobacco. Do you honestly believe that the government is going to take that kind of loss without making up for it somewhere else. Maybe bottled water or candy bars would be a good place to start. Banning tobacco would create billions of dollars of lost tax income for the government. Right now all of us filthy smokers, everyone hates so much are soaking up that cost. But what happens when all that money is gone? Where are they going to make it up at? Lets not forget about the added problems of a prohibition situation like this. You will have to increase spending on law enforcement to deal with the black market tobacco industry that is going to spring up. Then add in the organized crime that will develop to smuggle the tobacco into the country from God only knows. I guess everyone forgot what happened in the 1930's?Topping all of that off will be the thousands of jobs that will be lost in our already destroyed economy. Tobacco farms, manufactures and venders will all be out of work. So yes I think it is a great idea to ban it all together. We might as well put one more nail in the coffin that is the United States.

I'm not opposed to their being regulations on tobacco or making it less desireable for teens to smoke, but did you even do a survey of the teens who smoke?  When I was in high school, every kid who smoked, including me, smoked Marlboro Lights, or Newports.  I never even heard of flavored cigarettes until I was 22.  Much less be able to afford an expensive pack cigarettes like those.  If you want to make it harder for teens to get cigarettes, why not impose a massive fine for the individual and establishment who are caught selling or distributing to minors.  Lets say to the tune of $50,000 and $100,000 to the offenders.  No one will likely sell with those kinds of fines in the mix.      Also, it saddens me to think that you couldn't even see that Phillip Morris wants less nicotene in their products.  Hmm, less nicotene means more cigarettes smoked and since they have burn accelerators in them, they sell more cigarettes to us, and on it goes.

If you want the tests do them on yourself or a human who smokes, after all isn't the point to find the affects in humans; logically you would experiment on humans to find this results. If you knew genetics you would understand the different chemical resistance and affects that different animals can with stand and that occur including human animals which is due to the evolution in it's genetic code or a certain mutation in the individuals allele.

The lethal dose (LD) of nicotine is 6.5 to 13 mg per kg. Since an average 1 year old is around 10 kgs, a LD would be 65 to 130 mg of nicotine. An 1.8% solution of liquid nicotine sold in shops is 18 mg/mL.Therefore, just a 10mL bottle would contain 180 mg of nicotine (18 mg/mL x 10 mL) which is much higher than the LD for an average 1 year old child.

I, along with the many thousands of smokers, have experienced serious health problems from the new FSC cigarettes, and I hope that once the FDA takes over, they will find that there have been new toxic chemicals added to them, and will have these so called FSC cigarettes banned! It is your duty to make sure that we are not being poisoned. I have not seen any evidence where the FSC's are any safer for preventing fires than the original cigarettes. In fact, it has been more of a problem since the FSC's came along. Many smokers have already complained about the fire hazards of the FSC cigarettes. For example: the fire falling off while smoking an FSC, and burning them, their clothes, their furniture, etc.   Smokers, as a whole, should not be punished for one individual smoker's irresponsibilty. Saving 700-900 lives a year from cigarette related fires, does NOT constitute killing thousands of smokers from these toxic FSC cigarettes!

We, as american citizens, should've had a say as to whether we wanted the FSC cigarettes or not, since we ARE the ones who pay the absolutely outrageous taxes on our cigarettes!"

Most of the supplies for electronic cigarettes are only available online.  I understand the concern for minors obtaining said devices and nicotine flavored liquid over the internet.  I have to say that one of the regulations that I  might  suggest is that you must be 18 and older to purchase, also provide a picture identification to confirm age of products being sold. A copy of a photo id with date of birth on id sent to vedors online to keep on file.  Once obtained by said vendors they would be put on a list that confirms that upon each order.  As a consumer the  vendors i see selling items online have you  confirm that you are 18 or older to purchase.  If electronic cigarettes are not for sale via internet I will not be able to use electronic cigarettes.  I have been using electronic cigarettes for over 10 months now and have not used regular tobacco cigarettes since.

628,FDA-2015-N-1514-0206,"Hello my name is Daniel I am 31 years old. I started smoking when I was 15 years old and tried to quit multiple times with everything from gum, patches, cold turkey and about everything else you could try with about the longest success being a week or two before going back to cigarettes. About 2 years ago I got a mark ten e cigarette for free in the mail from phillip Morris to try out. It seemed to help some but just never was satisfying and the cost was equal to smoking and never stuck with it and kept going back to smokimg. Then I decided to go to a vaping shop and get a real vaping device and try it out. I started on 18 mg nicotine and within about 3 months I moved down to 3 mg nicotine and haven't touched a cigarette since the day I started vaping with a actual real vaping device and not a cheap gas station one. The benefits I notice are amazing. Since starting vaping I can breath from my nose now. Before when I was smoking I had trouble to even breath from my nose and always was clogged with boogers every morning. I hacked up phlegm everyday and coughed like crazy when I woke up. Since vaping all of these symptoms have gone away. I no longer smell like a ashtray and my overall heath has improved I can hold my breath much longer now. Vaping has changed my life and millions of others life's as well. To create unneeded regulations against vaping in my opinion is a horrible idea and the only logical reason for the government to do it would be for profit and political corruption. I do believe in keeping it out of the hands of children and creating child proof bottles and things like that but for grown adults having nicotine in the liquids is a must. There is no doubt cigarettes are worse for everyone than vaping electronic cigarette's are. This is freedom from cancer sticks and is the only thing that has worked in 16 years for me and I know millions of others. Please don't take away my hope and freedom from cigarette's."

Therefore there is no excuse for perpetuating cruel testing on living, feeling animals.  Even rats have feelings and deserve not to suffer needlessly.  Thank you."
686,FDA-2009-N-0294-0362,"Dear Ladies / Gentlemen:On behalf of Shorewood Packaging, a folding carton manufacturer based in New York, NY, we would like to comment on the process of developing regulation for the tobacco products industry.We provide significant employment in our U.S. plants in the manufacturing of tobacco packaging.  We have invested tens of millions of dollars in capability to print packaging for a number of major U.S. based tobacco products companies.  Therefore, we consider ourselves a stakeholder to any U.S. change in regulation that would change the packaging requirements for our customers.We ask that, in this process, the FDA use an evidence-based approach to develop regulations that would impact packaging changes.  The regulatory community plays a role that may significantly impact the cost of packaging that we make.  It's likely that regulatory changes that impact printed packaging for tobacco products could impact efficiency, cost and employment in the manufacturing supply chain.It is important that any change in regulation a) considers the costs of the change, b) allows the supply chain ample time to implement any change; to thereby mitigate cost and hardship in our plants, and c) attempts to manage implementation of regulations without increasing the size of the regulatory apparatus, which may lead to new taxes, user feeds or other costs of operation.On behalf of Shorewood Packaging, thank you for your consideration"

690,FDA-2012-D-0071-1692,I am disgusted by the continued disregard for life. Smoking kills. What more needs to be said or tested??
692,FDA-2009-N-0294-0339,"The three concerns that I have are: the inclusion of tobacco industry representatives on the Advisory Committee, the inclusion of menthol flavoring as an allowed additive, possible undermining of local and state smokefree laws, and the regulation of new tobacco/nicotine products such as the e-cigarette. Even though the tobacco industry industry representatives are non-voting, they can use the internal committee knowledge to undermine proposed regulations, and their involvement should be very limited. The RICO case found many ways that the tobacco industry used their influence to thwart the best interests of the American people. Also the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control specifically bars tobacco industry involvment on advisory groups. Menthol should be not be allowed in cigarettes. Research clearly shows increased risk of lung cancers that are deeper and harder to detect. I don't understand why menthol was ever excluded from the banned additive list except for political reasons.In addition, any actions that the FDA takes should not undermine the local and state efforts to pass and enforce strong smokefre laws, which have been very effective in reducing secondhand smoke exposure and smoking rates.Finally, products such as e-cigarettes should be regulated as a tobacco product or drug delivery system. The research on long-term effects is lacking, and some states have already passed bans on these products due to the potential of their widespread use and public health effects. Tobacco control advocates are looking foward to the increased regulation of tobacco  products. The American public is trusting the FDA to protect them from a product that has no safe level of exposure. This puts the U.S. government in a strange position. I certainly hope that the F.D.A. adopts as strong regulations as possible in order to truly protect the American public and prevent future lawsuits."
694,FDA-2012-D-0071-0510,"To the FDA:In some of the horrendous tobacco tests that could be conducted, rats would be forced to breathe tobacco smoke for as long as six hours a day for months at a time by jamming the animals into tiny canisters and pumping concentrated cigarette smoke directly into their noses. The animals would then be killed and their bodies dissected.For decades, the tobacco industry used results from these misleading animal tests to deny the link between smoking and cancer because animals forced to inhale cigarette smoke don't develop the same diseases that human smokers do.Belgium, Germany, the U.K., and other countries have banned the testing of tobacco products on animals, and all the tobacco safety tests required by the Canadian government are modern, non-animal methods.Please do not torture/test on animals.  Its cruel and unnecessary.  There are humane alternatives to testing that do not involve  experimenting on innocent animals."
696,FDA-2012-D-0071-1655,I am very upset to learn that animals are forced to inhale toxic cigarette smoke when humans voluntarily do so. I feel that these tests are a waste of my tax dollars. Testing on animals seems pointless when humans are very willing subjects and the results can be instantly used to improve human life. I hope that money us better spent and these animals are released to a sanctuary.
698,FDA-2012-D-0071-1755,I am against any testing on animals from the tobacco industry. We know that cigarette smoke causes cancer. I don't understand what it is that anyone thinks they'll accomplish by subjecting animals to inhumane smoke tests. This is disgusting. I think enough lives have been wasted because of the tobacco industry. 
699,FDA-2009-N-0294-0439,Pharmacies should be prohibited from selling tobacco products. The statistics cited in this call for comments brief underscore a clear and counter-productive conflict of interest; one cannot promote health while simultaneously sell substances like cigraettes that destroy health.  The passage of such a ban in San Franscico and Walgreen's failed challenge to this ban indicates a) the so-called health care busineeses are more concerned about their bottom line than the medical and social responsibility they market; and b) that such a law will survive such misplaced and self-serving challenges.

702,FDA-2012-D-0071-1073,"I am shocked to learn that the FDA continues to support animal experimentation on tobacco products. Considered archaic and fundamentally flawed, product testing on animals lacks social legitimacy and validation.Furthermore, to foster an idea that consumers continually support animal experimentation due to some inaccurate notion that it will prevent them from being harmed is unprincipled. Animals suffer drastically different effects from tobacco use than humans.  Tobacco use and abuse can factually lead to harm regardless of how many animals are wrongfully killed during the product testing phase.Please make both the ethical and financially-responsible decision to discontinue animal experimentation immediately: remove any language recommending or allowing animal tests from its draft guidance on tobacco product testing;  join an increasing body of countries who are listening to a concerned and attentive consumer population who refuse to be complicit in the inherently malicious and ineffective industry of animal experimentation.Regards,Diane Baxter-MacArthur"

709,FDA-2013-N-0521-0388,"The comments below are submitted by Maansi Bansal-Travers, PhD, MS, on behalf of Roswell Park Cancer Institute’s Tobacco Research Program in response to Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) request for comments on the scientific evaluation of menthol in cigarettes (Docket Number FDA-2013-N-0521).  We submit for consideration to the FDA that, based on the current scientific evidence, menthol cigarettes and the marketing of menthol cigarettes increases the likelihood of youth becoming smokers and causes net population harm.  The following comment is submitted to the FDA as supporting evidence to remove menthol as a “characterizing flavor” in tobacco products, particularly cigarettes.On the basis of the evidence presented in our comment, we believe it is justified to ban menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes and any such regulation should take into account the multiple, varied ways by which menthol may impart its characterizing flavor in cigarettes.Please see attached document for complete comment with references."
710,FDA-2011-N-0467-0019,"I must say that the portions of this document pertaining to the sale of electronic cigarettes are ludicrous at best. This industry is thriving completely on its own merit and has an extremely large consumer basis, of which I am one, who are very open with the sharing of information, thus creating a quality check system for all electronic cigarette vendors that functions completely on its own.I am one of thousands that has used electronic cigarettes to quit the devastating vice that is smoking tobacco. Since quitting cigarettes and vaping in its place, my physician has been thoroughly astounded by the immense changes in my physical health. I was diagnosed with chronic bronchitis not long before quitting, and it has now cleared up entirely. My newly regained lung capacity thanks to electronic cigarettes has truly been a godsend, not to mention I can smell and taste again.I understand the need for quality control and a competitive market, thus I am highly suggesting that portions of this bill be re-written. According to the CEO of Smoke-Free Pennsylvania, on a scale of harm where cigarettes are a 100 and other forms of smoking cessation (including but not limited to nicotine patches and gum) are a 1, electronic cigarettes would not rank more than a 2.Part of the reason so many of us have been able to easily transition to vaping is with the help of online vendors who have already implemented their own age verification (18+) systems. In addition, many would not have been able to fully quit nicotine using vaping, or begin vaping for harm reduction purposes and never touch another cigarette if it were not for the variation of strengths and flavors available to us. I'm sure I speak for thousands when I say that limiting our choices in such an area is not only harmful to this thriving industry, but will cause a massive decline in the amount of people who are able to successfully quit using e-cigs.Please make the right decision. You will be saving countless lives."

713,FDA-2009-N-0294-0083,"When all flavored cigarettes are banned in 3 months, all remaining flavored stock need to be removed from shelves.  Otherwise enforcement is impossible.The tobacco industry must be prohibitied from using social network internet sources such as Facebook because a recent article in Pediatrics online states teens see more pro-tobacco messages than anti-tobacco messages on these networks.  This leads them to think smoking is OK and cool."
714,FDA-2009-N-0294-0502,It is sad to see that our rights as citizens are slowly being taken away. Now you guys can control what kind of cigarettes we smoke. I can tell you that I am highly unsatisfied with your decision to ban flavored tobacco.
715,FDA-2015-N-1514-0304,"As a Pediatrician, I urge the FDA to take swift action to protect children from poisoning from liquid nicotine products.  This also should include safety warnings on all liquid nicotine products and child proof safety caps on all such products. Adolescents need to especially be warned about the addictive nature of liquid nicotine. Flavoring liquid nicotine makes it especially attractive to curious young children. Sincerely, Dr. Elizabeth Susan Hodgson, MD  FAAP"
717,FDA-2013-N-0521-0384,"This comment is in response to Tobacco Product Standards questions #2 and #3, on the potential regulation of other types of additives and flavors, and the potential regulation of other types of tobacco products.In addition to regulating the use of menthol in cigarettes, the FDA should study the effects of additives in smokeless “non-combustible” tobacco products, especially dipping tobacco, or moist snuff.  And the study should not be limited to menthol additives in smokeless tobacco, but to all additive flavorings.  Dipping tobacco has been show to cause a multitude of mouth cancers including cancer of the tongue, lip, cheek, gums, and on the base and roof of the mouth.  And while with cigarettes we’re used to seeing the primary additive as menthol, in smokeless tobacco that is not the case.  Companies that make dipping tobacco use a range of different flavors to attract customers.  For example, Grizzly, Kodiak, Longhorn, Stoker’s, and Husky all make a wintergreen and a mint flavored dipping tobacco.  Kayak makes wintergreen, mint, apple, peach, and grape.  Timber Wolf makes wintergreen, cool wintergreen, mint, apple, and peach.  Skoal makes wintergreen, mint, spearmint, Xtra mint, Xtra wintergreen, apple, cherry, berry, citrus, peach, and vanilla.  And Copenhagen makes wintergreen, mint, smooth hickory, and a whiskey blend flavored dip. Due to the high number of children under the age of eighteen—especially in certain regions of the country—who view dipping tobacco as a safe alternative to cigarettes, it is likely that many of them are initiated into the habit with the multiplicity of fruit and mint flavored products.  In fact, in certain communities, the fruit flavors (peach, apple, grape, berry, citrus) are seen as a good “starter” dip, before users—still teenagers—graduate to the range of mint flavors (mint, wintergreen, cool wintergreen, Xtra mint, Xtra wintergreen) which are known to be higher in nicotine content.  This range of flavors potentially makes dipping tobacco more palatable for young users.  Like in cigarettes, mint flavors could be reducing the irritation and harshness associated with smokeless tobacco.While the advertising of menthol cigarette is the subject of review in this current comment period, the marketing of flavored smokeless tobacco is clearly also an important issue for further study—one need only walk into a convenience store in some areas and see the rows of bright multi-colored tins displayed as if they were candy.  As part of the FDA’s implementation of the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, a study should be prepared on the effect and the marketing of the range of available dipping tobacco flavor additives.  In the end, regulation might be appropriate. "
718,FDA-2013-N-0521-0013,"Re:  Docket ID: FDA-2013-N-0521    Comment on Menthol in Cigarettes, Tobacco Products Dear Food and Drug Administration:Congress chose to ban flavored cigarettes not because they are more harmful or addictive, but because it believed that candy and fruit flavors were a significant factor in the marketing of cigarettes. Safety aside, the FDA has no choice but to apply the same criteria in judging menthol. The central question is whether menthol plays a role in marketing cigarettes to consumers. As the 1999 founder and director of WhyQuit.com, the leading abrupt nicotine cessation (cold turkey) education, motivation and support site, the method that each year generates more long-term successful U.S. ex-smokes than all other methods combined, I strongly support elimination of the use of menthol in cigarettes.The FDA need only look at store menthol cigarette marketing at more than 140,000 neighborhood convenience stores.  There, the industry spends billions annually on cool, refreshing, flavor and pleasure menthol marketing. There is strong evidence that menthol acts as an anesthetic agent that makes cigarette smoking more appealing by masking the harshness of burning tobacco. The addition of menthol deceives consumers into thinking that cigarettes are less harsh and therefore safer. Furthermore, for more than half a century, menthol cigarette brands have been disproportionately targeted to African Americans.Congress banned the easy flavorings while handing the FDA the one opposed by powerful economic interests.  Banning menthol would not only diminish youth smoking dependency onset by removing menthol's analgesic effects,  it will likely aid in accelerating both nicotine cessation and transfer to cleaner forms of delivery, such as smokeless, e-cigarettes and replacement nicotine. While I hope that the FDA is at last determined and serious about putting a dent in our nation's leading cause of preventable death, please understand that, in regard to smoking cessation, my confidence in the FDA was shattered long ago.  Thirty-one years ago, the FDA approved nicotine gum based upon two studies, despite obvious and glaring study blinding concerns discussed and reviewed by the advisory panel.  Since then, the FDA has continued to allow use of placebo controls despite clear and compelling evidence that 3 to 4 times as many assigned to placebo correctly declare their assignment as guess wrong, and can do so within 24-48 hours of cessation (peak withdrawal).  While approved products consistently show greater efficacy over placebo, they have proven ineffective and consistently fail to prevail over cold turkey and unassisted quitters in population level reviews.  Whether considering light or heavy smokers, the evidence is clear, real-world toying with replacement nicotine undercuts cessation.  We've watched as FDA approved quitting products have undercut and stalled cessation, while likely costing hundreds of thousands of lives.  As you can see, it's my opinion that the FDA and botched quitting product approval is the primary reason for America's failed smoking cessation policy.  The evidence is also clear that menthol is being used to market cigarettes and mask smoke's toxins.   Here's hoping the FDA at last begins giving weight to real-world evidence as billions in menthol marketing is impossible to miss. John R. PolitoNicotine Cessation EducatorDirector, WhyQuit.com "

732,FDA-2009-N-0294-0408,"The American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) is pleased to submit comments in response to the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) request for input into the approaches and actions it should consider initially to “increase the likelihood of reducing the incidence and prevalence of tobacco use and protecting the public health.  The AARC is a national professional association representing approximately 50,000 respiratory therapists.  Our comments focus on the general category of “Smoking Cessation.”BackgroundThe AARC has been actively involved in tobacco control and smoking cessation for over two decades.  We continue to partner with public health associations organized under the coalition umbrella (Tobacco Free Kids) sponsored by the American Lung Association, American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association and this past spring worked with our Coalition partners to move the successful passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. On the Federal level, the AARC has been committed to encouraging legislative and regulatory efforts to control tobacco use, especially among children, and has assisted with the development and sponsorship of smoking cessation programs.  A representative from our Association was also a member of the government panel charged with developing the current federal guidelines on smoking cessation as published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Smoking Cessation and the Respiratory TherapistRespiratory therapists are on the front line in providing care to patients with asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, lung cancer, and other respiratory diseases. As a highly specialized allied health discipline, respiratory therapists focus on the management and treatment of patients with acute and complex respiratory problems in a broad spectrum of settings and are acutely aware of the devastating effects due to use of tobacco products. As part of their scope of practice in assessing and developing patient care plans, respiratory therapists are in a unique position to dispense tobacco cessation counseling as they are called on daily to evaluate and administer physician-ordered treatments for tobacco-related respiratory diseases. Respiratory therapists continue to provide tobacco cessation counseling on an outpatient basis, in physicians’ offices, and in conjunction with pulmonary rehabilitation services. The respiratory therapist is a key health care provider to explain to patients how tobacco affects their pulmonary diseases.How AARC Can Help FDAAs part of its position statement on “Tobacco and Health”, the AARC recognizes its responsibility to the public by taking a strong position against cigarette smoking and the use of tobacco in any of its various forms.  In view of the evidence, which confirms the health-threatening consequences of all tobacco in both active and passive forms, the AARC is committed to the elimination of smoking and the use of any tobacco products and the inhalation of any toxic substance.One of the on-going activities of the AARC is its Tobacco Free Lifestyle Roundtable.  Our Roundtable members have created a pocket guide on quitting tobacco for patients and the public that is in final review and will soon start work on a companion guide for clinicians, to be printed by the AARC in the near future.  The Roundtable is collaborating with the Smoking Cessation Leadership Center (University of California-San Francisco) on this initiative.  As soon as the guides are available, the AARC would be glad to make them available to the FDA as a means of educating the public on the importance of smoking cessation counseling as a way to protect the public health.  Another project under consideration by our Roundtable is the creation of a teaching module on tobacco treatment and prevention specifically designed for respiratory therapy educators.  The AARC also collaborated with the Environmental Protection Agency and the American Respiratory Care Foundation in the development of continuing education web modules which include a presentation on how smoking interacts with asthma and approaches to tobacco treatment.FDA Needs to Emphasize Professional Smoking Cessation Counseling We recommend FDA add information to its website that apprises the public of the option of smoking cessation counseling as an adjunct to use of smoking cessation products.   While we applaud FDA for including the AARC in its list of outside organizations as a resource for helping patients to quit smoking, we believe there is one option that is not emphasized enough to the public and that is professional smoking cessation counseling, provided by physicians, respiratory therapists, and other qualified healthcare professionals. The AARC would be happy to work with the FDA in any capacity as it undertakes the important initiative of implementing the provisions of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.  We especially offer our help with the creation/promotion of web-based training for health care professionals.If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Anne Marie Hummel, Director Regulatory Affairs, at 703-492-9764 or hummel@aarc.org.Sincerely, Timothy R.

Though he tried many times to quit, he was just unable to succeed.As a professional in the pharmacy industry I am aware of the regulations that are possible. For example, pseudoephedrine has been put behind the counter in virtually every pharmacy in an effort to curb meth production and limits have been placed on the amount that can be purchased and sales must be logged. It should be noted that the number of methamphetamine-related deaths pales in comparison to the number of tobacco related deaths. I know that banning tobacco will never work. But please consider limiting daily sales to each individual. There are other medications for which physicians must be enrolled in special programs or registered with manufacterers before they can purchase or prescribe (Thalomid, Accutane, Clozaril, etc). Perhaps initiating a registration process before being allowed to purchase tobacco could help curb abuse.Additionally, please consider a ban on smoking in places where non-smokers may be affected. For example, if I take my toddler to the park to play or even just take her for a walk, I do not want her to be inhaling second hand smoke. Smokers complain about their rights, but we have the right to breathe clean air too. If they want to smoke in their own home that is their choice, but please do not allow them to damage my child's developing lungs."
762,FDA-2012-D-0071-1789,"Use of Modified Risk Tobacco Products (MRTPs) presents challenges both in terms of avoidance of possible negative effects and in terms of exploitation of potential positive effects. This makes it necessary to prevent harmful products to be marketed under false claims of safety, and this aspect has hitherto been the dominating one in the current discussion. However, in order not to hamper the exploitation of potential benefits, it is important also to prevent spread of unduly exaggerated and unspecified claims of dangers. There should be a balanced assessment based on a recognition of the scientifically well proven fact that there is a continuum of risk from conventional cigarettes, modified risk cigarettes, Indian and African smokeless tobacco, fermented Western smokeless tobacco, non-fermented smokeless tobacco and medicinal nicotine products – the last two of those product categories representing health risks close to those of never tobacco users as demonstrated for example by Gartner et al, Lancet 2007. There are common misperceptions both about individual and public health effects of different MRTPs. It will be important promote such accurate public information that can eradicate such misperceptions so as has been pointed out for example by The Royal College of Physicians of London in its 2007 Report saying: “The epidemiology of tobacco use in Sweden suggests that if the public is offered a substantially less harmful smokeless tobacco product along with access to accurate information on relative risks, a substantial proportion can switch to the less harmful product. This has clear implications for public health.” "

772,FDA-2013-N-0521-0424,"I have worked in tobacco prevention for 20 years and currently serve as the Executive Director for the Colorado Tobacco Education and Prevention Alliance, a statewide non-profit.  The FDA should do the following:•Prohibit menthol as an additive at any level. •Forbid menthol in all tobacco products, not just cigarettes. •Bar menthol analogs and substitutes in tobacco products to ensure that the FDA’s action on menthol is not undermined by alternative products. •Promote culturally appropriate cessation services to maximize the opportunity for menthol smokers to quit rather than transition to a new tobacco product. The data to support this decision:The TPSAC report on menthol and your recent scientific report outline the public health basis and benefit to removing menthol from all tobacco products.  The new Centers For Disease Control report, released this month, outlined the concerning trends among youth and little cigars, hookah, and e-cigarettes – all products that are currently offered in menthol flavoring in Colorado and around the country. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/  The Surgeon General's report on youth and young adult tobacco use outlined the information from the once secret tobacco industry documents on their use of menthol to attract youth.http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2012/As far as the black market, in the letter you recently received from twenty-seven State Attorney's Generals calling for the removal of menthol from cigarettes, it was said “The specter of a black market is often raised to oppose regulation or taxes, but the threat of the emergence of a black market in menthol cigarettes should not be permitted to override the protection of public health.”  The tobacco industry has used the black argument to oppose price increases, what we know to be one of the most effective strategies for reducing use.Lastly, your decision must be comprehensive and and not rely on the tobacco industry to behave responsibly.  A complete removal of menthol, its analogs and substitutes, and any other measure needed to protect public health should be taken.  In the the federal RICO case decision against the tobacco industry, Judge Kessler outlined a decades long pattern of deceit by the tobacco companies.  She stated “Defendants have marketed and sold their lethal products with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success, and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted.”http://publichealthlawcenter.org/topics/special-collections/verdict-findings-united-states-v-philip-morris-collectionYour decision needs to take into account the documented history of the tobacco industry and their disregard for public health and safety.

811,FDA-2009-N-0294-0346,"Upon graduating from Johns Hopkins with a Master's degree in public health, I was ready to save lives, millions at a time.  I moved to Lawton, OK and found an exciting position as a health educator.  I also moved into the most tobacco ladened environment in my life.  Not only does the soldier I moved here for smoke, but so do my neighbors, fellow commuters, gamblers in the casinos, and venders at the Farmers Market I have helped establish.Having just studied, in detail, the in's and out's of behavior change, as well as having witnessed my partner's tobacco addiction, I rejoiced when I heard the FDA news. More stringent tobacco policy is needed to control tobacco, if anything, in order to protect the rights of non-smokers.  Let's be honest, when I was in school, the whole tobacco-prevention topic bored me to tears.  I felt like it was a battle already won. Why not talk about obesity--a pressing issue we can surely reverse with environmental change, just like tobacco.Then I moved to a poor, military town in SW Oklahoma, where I smoke in stranger's second-hand smoke about 3 or 4 times a day; on my way to work with my windows down, walking through a plume of smoke in a parking lot, sitting on my back porch while smokers walk by.And it's not just cigarettes.  It's dip.  And it's in workplaces, it's in back-pockets, in the small little pockets of ACU's (Army Combat Uniforms).Now, tobacco prevention is a new passion.  Federal legislation to prevent tobacco use is greatly needed in order to augment any type of prevention method I could hope to implement in Comanche County.  For instance, the newly-founded Farmer's Market I mentioned earlier received seed money from the Fit Kids of SW Oklahoma group, an obesity-prevention group.  Despite this kid-health association, the vendors would not agree to make the market a tobacco free place.  So parents bring their young children there, with cigarettes hanging from their mouthes, and I hang my head, in tears of defeat."

I am a physician deeply concerned about the public health consequences of this guidance. Human population studies, clinical intervention trials, and human-based cellular studies should remain the foundation of tobacco research. Animal studies were initially used to deny the smoking-lung cancer link. But decades of human epidemiology studies prove this link and other devastating effects tobacco has on human health. The Institute of Medicine says that it is not possible to make laboratory animals use tobacco products the way humans do, and there are inherent interspecies differences that prevent meaningful extrapolation of effects to humans. The self-addiction studies that FDA recommends be performed in animals, such as “place preference,” “drug discrimination,” and “self-administration” studies, are not only cruel, but tenuously linked to human behavior. Tobacco is inherently hazardous and poses serious risks to the user’s health and to the health of others.

852,FDA-2015-N-1514-0356,"I am commenting in regards to The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Proposed Rule: Nicotine Exposure Warnings and Child-Resistant Packaging for Liquid Nicotine, Nicotine-Containing ELiquid(s), and Other Tobacco Products as a concerned citizen. For the good of all consumers in the U.S., there should be clear text warnings on the packages of nicotine products explaining the most harmful health risks associated with the product. Just as all seriously harmful substances in the U.S. are labeled as hazardous, so too should nicotine and tobacco products. Tobacco and nicotine have no health benefits whatsoever, and should be treated as such. Also a symbol in the form of a typical hazardous waste symbol should be clearly displayed on the packaging of these products in case a person is unable to read the actual text on the package. Anyone using these products should be completely aware of its effects and health implications. As for the issue of child-proof packaging, this should be absolutely required for tobacco and nicotine products. Children have a habit of getting into things, especially when the item is used or coveted by adults in the child's environment. If a parent of a child uses tobacco or E-cigarettes around the home, the child will inevitably become curious and interested in the item. Any tobacco or nicotine product should be child-proof because of the extreme danger their use poses to children. The significant impact tobacco products could have on a child's life should necessitate packaging these products in a safe and responsible manner. This means packaging that is not only child-proof, but also clear labels warning a child of the dangers in using the product. Manufacturers of tobacco and nicotine products should be highly scrutinized by the FDA and the federal government and required by law to package their harmful products in the safest packaging available.

867,FDA-2009-N-0294-0478,"The Public Health Advocacy Institute (“PHAI”), initially established in 1979, has thirty years of experience focused on legal policy approaches to reduce the public health toll caused by tobacco products. PHAI is a non-profit public health law research organization based on the campus of Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.PHAI has collaborated with Northeastern University School of Law as consortium partners on three National Institutes of Health R01 studies, including a competitive renewal, addressing legal approaches to tobacco control; discerning tobacco industry attorneys’ roles on smoking and health issues as revealed in internal document archives; and identifying the use of personal responsibility argumentation to impede public health interventions. PHAI has worked under contract to the U.S. Department of Justice conducting research related to U.S. v. Philip Morris, Inc. and has performed tobacco control research funded by grants from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Legacy Foundation and contracts with Massachusetts Department of Public Health, The American Cancer Society, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. PHAI offers the following comments and recommendations regarding the development and implementation of the FDA Tobacco Product Regulations, in furtherance of the public health goal of significantly reducing smoking related mortality and morbidity under the FDA’s grant of regulatory authority pursuant to the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (“the Act”). Research designed to identify and evaluate the threshold range of nicotine yields that produce tobacco dependence in smokers should be actively commissioned and considered by the FDA and its Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee.  Prioritizing such research to inform the promulgation of tobacco product regulations is consistent with the Act’s stated purposes to empower the FDA “to set national standards controlling the manufacture"

878,FDA-2017-N-4678-0027,"The meeting of the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, convened by the Center for Tobacco Products to consider the application for Modified-Risk Tobacco Product status for Camel Snus, was very informative. The applicants laid out a clear case that complete switching from cigarettes to use of snus carries far less risk than smoking does for lung cancer, respiratory disease, heart disease, and oral cancer. The case was based on consistent data from multiple epidemiology studies, both in the US and abroad, as well as from in vitro, in vivo, and human clinical studies of biomarkers.In this regard, it was surprising that, while the committee supported the claimed risk-reduction for lung cancer and respiratory disease, it split in its vote on heart disease and oral cancer.  The votes against are contrary to the evidence presented, and the committee members explicitly-stated rationales for those votes makes that abundantly clear. It is this discrepancy between the science and the negative votes that I address in this comment. I will address this with regard to heart disease and oral cancer separately.SEE ATTACHED FILE WITH SPECIFIC DATA AND NARRATIVE FOR ORAL CANCER AND HEART DISEASE RISKIn summary the evidence clearly shows that using snus or switching to snus has far less risk for both heart disease and oral cancer. It is essential that these reduced risks be accurately communicated to the public in FDA-approved modified-risk advertisements for snus. The risk reduction statement for oral cancer and for heart disease should match since the scientific evidence is substantial as it is for lung cancer and respiratory disease. The magnitude of the difference is significant, consistent and replicated in the major studies for oral cancer and heart disease. While the degree of difference across four disease classes varies as expected, the scientific evidence cannot be ignored for two diseases and endorsed for two others if the same well accepted standards of scientific evidence are used. The statement proposed in the MRTP application of risk reduction for all four diseases (lung, respiratory, oral and heart) is scientifically true and accurate. For complete switching to these smokeless products from smoked cigarette products the magnitude ranges from over double to 4 times less risk for heart disease and oral cancer versus more than that for lung cancer. Double the reduction is still very substantial"

890,FDA-2013-N-0521-0291,"As a second-year Master of Public Health Student at Indiana University in Bloomington, IN, I have studied public health economics and public health policies and management, and feel qualified to comment on the potential regulation of menthol in cigarettes. Although from a public health perspective smoking is of huge concern, the leading cause for lung and throat cancers, cardiovascular disease, strokes, and death, I disagree with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposal for potential regulation of menthol in cigarettes.  The FDA’s decision was based health risks alone and did not take into account other societal consequences that may occur as a result of this policy.  The demand for menthol cigarettes will not simply disappear after than ban. A black market of contraband would increase if the FDA bans menthol cigarettes because the black market which already exists for cigarettes is extremely profitable. As a result, there would be a significant increase in criminal activity. Cigarette smuggling from other countries or other states is already widespread. If this regulation comes into law, the increase in the black market would allow criminal enterprises to flourish since the smuggling networks and means are already in place.  In addition, a significant contraband market may fuel more organized criminal organizations, as occurred during the period of alcohol prohibition in the United States. Therefore, law enforcement agencies would have an increased burden to monitor and enforce even more types of tobacco activity. Law enforcement does not need yet another negative element detrimentally impacting public safety which they will have to oversee. If the federal government requires additional enforcement resources by inadvertently creating a black market, this would take more revenue from tax payers, and become counterproductive."

904,FDA-2013-N-0521-0069,"Case number FDA-2013-N-0521 refers to the possible banning or over regulations of the menthol cigarette industry.  Please oppose these possible measures.Good-paying jobs with dependable benefits and opportunities for career advancement are hard to come by in this economy. In North Carolina, thousands of workers depend on the tobacco industry to support our families and build the foundation of a secure economic future. Those of us who work in this industry shouldn’t have to worry about the federal government making it harder for us to earn a living and support our families. If FDA bans menthol cigarettes our economic security and the well-being of our families will be in serious jeopardy.Rather than promote public health, a ban on menthol cigarettes would actually raise serious public health concerns. Currently, one out of every three smokers chooses menthols. It is likely that a substantial portion of these smokers will turn to the black market if menthol cigarettes are banned. As many studies have shown, black market cigarettes contain unknown and unregulated ingredients that can be dangerous for users. It is better that the production of menthol cigarettes stays with licensed and regulated manufactures.Over-regulating or banning menthol cigarettes is not sound public policy. It will not help accomplish the FDA’s goals of safeguarding consumers or preventing children from accessing cigarettes. Instead, it will fuel black market sales while costing thousands of Americans their jobs. It is inappropriate government interference that will have far-reaching unintended consequences.It is important to recognize what these new regulations could potentially do for federal, state, and local law enforcement.  Invariably, restrictive bylaws like the ones described in this particular FDA case lead to new instances of smuggled cigarettes, making it substantially more difficult for border agents and police officers on seemingly every level and jurisdiction to do the jobs they already have on their respective plates.For the reasons stated above, please keep menthol cigarettes legal."

I am submitting these comments on behalf of our company and its employees regarding the question of whether the FDA should regulate menthol in cigarettes.Smoker Friendly is a coalition of family-owned, small businesses operating tobacco retail establishments committed to responsibly retailing tobacco products.  Combined, Smoker Friendly’s members operate over 800 retail facilities which employ over 3,000 employees and service over 1,000,000 customers, with annual sales of approximately $750,000,000.  We also own a private label cigarette brand sold by our members, including a menthol category.As tobacco retailers and distributors, it is clear to us that unreasonable regulations, including a ban on menthol in cigarettes, would have significant unintended results.  Illicit tobacco markets are pervasive today.  Illicit markets will only become worse if the FDA imposes overly restrictive regulations on menthol in cigarettes.Contraband markets have a negative effect on public health because they undermine efforts to prevent underage smoking.  There is no way to monitor whether illicit cigarettes are sold to underage youth.  Illicit markets also result in a negative effect on public health because of the ingredients in counterfeit cigarettes.  Many health departments and government agencies have identified that counterfeit cigarettes have significantly more contaminants that pose far greater risks than those made by manufacturers in compliance with FDA requirements.  The contraband market that would be exacerbated by a ban would also increase criminal activity, including activities by organized crime and terrorist groups.  Federal and state law enforcement efforts already are constrained.  They will not be able to handle the resulting increase in criminal cases.If menthol cigarettes are banned, otherwise legal sales will be driven underground and outside of government supervision.  In addition some entrepreneurs will likely smuggle cigarettes from low-tax jurisdictions, self-mentholate them, and resell them-thereby further increasing criminal activities and adding even more enforcement burdens to law enforcement.  In addition, a ban on menthol cigarettes would have severe adverse effects on those employed in our industry.  Many thousands of working Americans - including those in our industry-rely on menthol sales for their jobs beyond the factory workers who manufacture them.  Overall, nearly 500,000 U.S. jobs depend in whole or in part on the sale of menthol through existing legal channels, according to a study by Altria.The Virginia Crime Commission found that “trafficking hurts all legitimate manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers,” because we are faced with unfair competition in the form of lower prices offered by competitors- i.e., illicit tobacco marketers. This is correct. A ban on menthol cigarettes would hit retailers including our company and our employees hard.Consumers would feel the impact of lost revenue and profits.  As one indirect consequence, retailers could be forced to raise prices for non-tobacco products to make up for lost cigarette sales.We speak from experience.  Retailers already face underground market competition in many product areas.  Adding menthol cigarettes to this inventory of items will drive even more sales underground- putting more companies and jobs at risk.  So the consequence would be lost jobs and lost tax revenues to federal, state and local governments.  Where will they turn to make up the shortfall? Unreasonable regulation of menthol cigarettes is a bad idea.  Banning menthol will trade good paying, legal jobs and taxes for illegal jobs and a thriving contraband market will have negative effects on public health. We respectfully request that the FDA consider these comments when developing regulations, policies and guidance related to menthol in cigarettes.  Smoker Friendly appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on matters impacting its members.  We look forward to continuing to engage the agency on these matters in the future.  If you have any questions concerning these comments, please contact either of us at 303 442-2520.Very truly yours,Smoker FriendlyMary SzarmachVP Trade Marketing and Govt. AffairsKenneth S.

I firmly believe that if minors can be prevented from starting the liklihood of becoming a smoker significantly is reduced; furthermore, nicotene is a drug.  As a drug, nicotene must be regulated as are many other pharmacological agents.  The sale of tobacco products should tightly regulated.  We already have limits on the sale of OTC cold medicines, consider the requirement to repackage cigarettes in smaller quantities and limit the number of total packs to 2 (two) per sale.  I'm suggesting 10 cigarettes per pack and limit the sale to 2 packs per sale.  While the total number is equal to a full pack this requirement will require facilities to retool their lines making it more expensive to manufacture.  The increased aggravation to consumers might be enough to help them get the message, alternately, it might just limit the total number of cigarettes per day.

States and localities are always competing for good manufacturing jobs. I am fortunate to have one of those jobs in the tobacco industry. But if menthol cigarettes, that make up one third of the products sold is banned, not only will I be at risk of losing my job so will many others in my community. Sometimes it seems that regulators don’t make the connection between what they do and what happens as a result. Let me make it perfectly clear that should FDA ban menthol cigarettes, many jobs will be lost. The federal government has the responsibility to protect public health and make sure that consumers have all the information they need to make good decisions for their health and safety. There are many ways to accomplish this important responsibility short of banning an entire industry. For cigarettes, strict age restrictions and health warning labels have been very effective at reducing teen smoking and informing consumers about the risks of smoking. However, putting the entire menthol cigarette industry out of business is stepping way over the line and is an example of extreme government overreach. Reject more regulations on menthols because it is the right thing to do. Cordially, Stephanie R Greene "

As a scientist (dual BS in Biology and MS in food science), I must ask the question of what answers could be unearthed by such studies.  In addition to any inhumane argument that could be posed, I sincerely question the possible gains of such research.  While murine models can be used to simulate a number of variables for humans, can anything be learned from piping smoke into an animal's lungs?  If so, what is its applicability to humans?  The humanity of the experimentation is also highly questionable... having personal experience with conducting human research and having to justify research to an IRB board, what is the reasoning for up to 6 hours of exposure or being confined to a glass tube? Tobacco is a luxury item, known to cause harm, that humans willfully expose themselves to despite its risks. In my opinion, lighting a tobacco product is that person signing off any/all medical treatment for its downstream effects.  My attitude may seem inhumane as well, but it is at least purposeful... I could justify that a person who willfully does harm should either be ineligible for health care related to respiratory malady (lowering premiums).

I would like to take this opportunity to make the following comments regarding FDA control of the Tobacco Industry.As the decision has been made to regulate the industry and not to ban tobacco products, I think it is important and fair, that decisions made regarding the future of tobacco products be based on scientific evidence.  If it’s possible to reduce the toxicity of tobacco products then those product choices should be made available to an informed public in clearly understandable language.The content of tobacco products should be plainly noted on packaging the same as food products.FDA expenses for regulating the industry should be scrutinized carefully.  Continual expense increases passed along to the cigarette companies will eventually be passed along to consumers.  Constant cigarette price increases will make black market activity more profitable and therefore more likely.Regulations and timelines should be carefully considered and made readily available to ensure all industry stakeholders have adequate opportunity to comply.In closing, I hope and expect that the FDA will work to ensure adults who choose to use tobacco products will have the best products available to them at a reasonable price.Thank you."

1100,FDA-2011-N-0467-0006,"I have recently read your proposed regulations on non face to face tobacco sales and distribution.  While I can appreciate your attempts to curtail underage consumption of tobacco goods, I do not think your new regulations will lower the amount of underage users. Your proposed regulations seem to be aimed at Internet sales. Because it is harder to track and manage sales across state lines, the Internet has quickly become a convenient source for citizens to obtain goods illegally. People have turned to online marketplaces to purchase cigarettes and tobacco products because you usually do not have to verify your identity and you can have the items delivered directly to your door. You are proposing that vendors verify a buyer’s age as well as require the buyer to prove their identity and sign off upon delivery. While this seems like a good strategy, a young adult can see this as a business opportunity just as many people see purchasing cigarettes and alcohol for minors as a source of money. They can buy the products legally and then turn around and sell them for a profit to minors with little risk. While these new regulations may make some minors think twice before purchasing tobacco, they will find ways around the rules. Unfortunately, no matter what steps are taken, underage consumption of tobacco products will never cease. Minors who wish to smoke will always find a way to obtain tobacco and while we can work tirelessly to educate people about the risks and hazards of smoking, there will never be a way to 100% eliminate it.

But decades of human epidemiology studies prove this link and other devastating effects tobacco has on human health.The Institute of Medicine says that it is not possible to make laboratory animals use tobacco products the way humans do, and there are inherent interspecies differences that prevent meaningful extrapolation of effects to humans.The self-addiction studies that FDA recommends be performed in animals, such as “place preference,” “drug discrimination,” and “self-administration” studies, are not only cruel, but tenuously linked to human behavior.Tobacco is inherently hazardous and poses serious risks to the user’s health and to the health of others.

It has been 7 months and I have not had a single chew and feel great.I like having the choice of various flavors of e-juice and nicotine strength. I started at 24 nic and I am currently on 6 Nic.I do not understand how the FDA can crush the vaping industry. If I do not have vape products I will go back to chewing tobacco.I feel that is what the FDA Truly wants to happen. Why not set the grandfather date to 8/8/2016 the products currently on the market are much safer than 2007. But wait did big tobacco have e-gigs in 2007.

But decades of human epidemiology studies prove this link and other devastating effects tobacco has on human health.The Institute of Medicine says that it is not possible to make laboratory animals use tobacco products the way humans do, and there are inherent interspecies differences that prevent meaningful extrapolation of effects to humans. The self-addiction studies that FDA recommends be performed in animals, such as “place preference,” “drug discrimination,” and “self-administration” studies, are not only cruel, but tenuously linked to human behavior.

I cheer for those who fought for the new FDA legistion, as I hope it will further prevent people from starting to use tobacco or quit using tobacco. However, some the exemptions in the new FDA legislation concern me. I beleive the new regulation should extend its juristition over other forms of tobacco besides cigarettes--cigars, little cigars, cigarillos, pipes, and hookah are also harmful to humans and still incur addition and physical consequences. Additionally, mentolated cigarettes should NOT be exempt from the new ban on flavored cigarettes. Menthol is the most widely used flavor in cigarettes, particularly among African Americans, and should not receive a special consideration.Please take my comments seriously, as I, just like you, are trying to protect my fellow Americans from the harmful effects of the most deadly legal product in the United States.

1177,FDA-2015-N-1514-0309,"As a pediatrician, I strongly call for the need for adequate labeling and appropriate packaging for liquid nicotine products. These products are currently being inappropriately targeted to children through the use of child-friendly packaging and labels.

In that vain, I want you to know how I precisely feel regarding the action that the FDA should take:The FDA should determine that mentholated cigarettes clearly is the gateway for teenagers and young adults to start smoking and the tobacco industry has known this for decades and therefore they target market their advertising toward this segment of the population and in particular to low income minorities. It is preposterous that in 2009 Congress gave the FDA permission to ban flavored tobacco products with the exception of menthol. Mentholated tobacco products are clearly marketed toward this same vulnerable young populace as flavored tobacco products however, Congress specifically held off from giving the FDA the authority to ban menthol cigarettes.In 2009, it was obvious this absurdity occurred due to a compromise that the tobacco industry was willing to live with. I repeat, the tobacco industry was willing to live with and the members of Congress who were and are still beholden to the tobacco cartel would agree to.The tobacco industry has had their four years of bought time to expand their marketing to e-cigarettes so it is now time to eliminate mentholated cigarettes from the market. It is time that the FDA consider menthol to be the same as fruit flavors, as well as flavors such as chocolate and vanilla which have been banned.It is a no brainer. If the FDA wants to do the job that they are sanctioned for, then they should end the sale of menthol cigarettes promptly."

1187,FDA-2009-N-0294-0471,My name is Chad Owen and I am the Vice President of Business Affairs for Chambers & Owen.  I am the fifth generation of our company that has been in business since 1891.  We employ approximately 300 people.  Tobacco products comprise a large portion of our business.  We fully intend to comply with any and all rules and regulations the FDA imposes on tobacco products.  The tobacco industry is one of the most complex in the United States.   It is my hope that the FDA relies on the companies that have been distributing tobacco products for many years for insight and advice.  Many tobacco regulations at both the state and federal levels are very vague.  The cigarette flavor ban information was equally as vague and confusing.  It is also my hope that the FDA does their best to make any future regulations clear and concise so that wholesalers can follow their intent and fully uphold the laws.  I also hope that the FDA is sensitive to the affects their decisions have on wholesalers.  Sell thru periods are a must.  Most wholesalers simply cannot afford to sit on product that has been deemed illegal.  It could seriously threaten a company's future if they have to incur excess inventory costs without a sell thru period.  It is also important that the FDA realizes that all wholesalers do is distribute products.  We do not have control over how the manufacturer produces the product and therefore should not be punished if something the manufacturer produces does not meet FDA criteria.Thank you for your time and consideration.

Ninety percent of smokers began smoking before the age of 18 years, so it is critical that we protect our youth from a lifelong, deadly addiction.

1224,FDA-2012-N-0143-0028,"I would like to encourage the FDA to look at the effect of heat on some of these additive chemicals. Researchers at Portland State University found the heat from e-cigarettes resulted in the formation of carcinogens from the solvents propylene glycol and glycerol (Jensen 2017). However the FDA clearly lists propylene glycol as an approved inactive ingredient for the inhalation route. Also a prior FDA-approved inhaler called Tornalate contained propylene glycol as an ingredient and was proven to be safe. So I believe classifying propylene glycol, for example, as a respiratory toxicant across the board is incorrect as it is really the application of heat to this chemical which causes the problem. It would be more correct to say that devices which apply heat to vaporize these chemicals are dangerous, whereas devices which atomize like the inhaler would not carry the same risk.References:Jensen RP, et al.

CAADE has stepped up efforts to deal with this issue by calling for the addiction treatment community to use its expertise in developing better tools to help curb smoking. One of the most promising tools we now have is the use of electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation, and CAADE has officially endorsed their use. We are starting to see 50-80% reductions in tobacco cigarettes use in treatment centers that encourage use of vaping. I fully support regulations that make it hard for minors to vape.

I am a tobacco control professional that has worked for over five years specifically with the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community on the issue of smoking.   There is a great deal of data which shows that the LGBT community smokes significantly more than the general population.  The most recent data in California shows that LGBTs smoke twice as much as all others in our state. There is also evidence that our community smokes menthol at a high rate as well.  A 2010 report from the National Youth Advocacy Coalition (NYAC) -- see attached -- found that 71% of the LGBT young adults between 18 and 24 years of age that they surveyed smoked menthol.  This is consistent with the results of the FDA’s recent report that indicates a higher rate of menthol smoking among other minorities that face discrimination.As the FDA’s research also concluded, menthol increases the likelihood that youth and young adults will start smoking, become more heavily addicted to nicotine, and have a more difficult time quitting.Banning the use of menthol flavoring in tobacco products would help everyone, but it would have the largest impact on segments of the population, such as the LGBT community, that already smokes more and uses menthol products at a higher rate than others.I would like to respectfully request that a ban on the use of menthol in tobacco products be adopted as soon as possible.Thank you for your time and consideration.Sincerely,Brian DavisCalifornia Tobacco Control Program CoordinatorTri-City Health CenterFremont, CA 94538"

1263,FDA-2009-N-0294-0279,"Stores should not be allowed to advertise tobacco products on their marquee signs, especially when they are in the vicinity of a school.  The attached photos show a marquee at Vine Street Market in Tooele, Utah with Marlboro cigarettes on sale.  The photo shows Tooele High School in the background.  The store is literally less than 200 feet from the school.  The week before this photo was taken, the marquee was advertising Copenhagen on sale.  So they are appealing to all types of tobacco users.  Across the street (not visible in the photo) is a city park and the public, indoor swimming pool.I don't think there should be any advertising of tobacco allowed on the outside of a store.  Even if a school is not in the direct vicinity of a convenience store, there are some stores located on the main route to a school, and therefore the advertising can't be ignored.Unfortunately, I tried to attach two photos, but it would not work."

Animal studies were initially used to deny the smoking-lung cancer link. But decades of human epidemiology studies prove this link and other devastating effects tobacco has on human health. The Institute of Medicine says that it is not possible to make laboratory animals use tobacco products the way humans do, and there are inherent interspecies differences that prevent meaningful extrapolation of effects to humans.  The self-addiction studies that FDA recommends be performed in animals, such as “place preference,” “drug discrimination,” and “self-administration” studies, are not only cruel, but tenuously linked to human behavior"

I look forward to your agency tackling this new responsibility with vigor.I am also writing to urge you to enforce the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in a way that lays the groundwork for full, constructive U.S. participation in the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). As you know, the U.S. is one of the few remaining countries that have not ratified this treaty, so our citizens are not yet protected by its life-saving measures.You will need to be vigilant, as there is one glaring inconsistency between this new law and the global tobacco treaty. Because Big Tobacco has a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict of interest with public health, the treaty safeguards health policy against tobacco industry interference.Unfortunately, this new legislation gives the tobacco industry a seat at the table in setting FDA policies. Including industry representatives on the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee is akin to letting the fox guard the henhouse. The tobacco corporations will seek to exploit this loophole, just as they are trying to get governments around the world to ignore their obligations under the FCTC.I urge you to resist and bring to light any attempts by the tobacco industry to undermine FDA regulation. Along with other members of Corporate Accountability International, I will be closely following the exercise of your new authority, and thank you in advance for your work to protect our kids from Big Tobacco's dirty tricks and predatory marketing.Sincerely, Rev.

1281,TTB-2010-0004-0099,"Taxes are getting out of control in the U.S.  I believe that the middle class suffers enough in this society to have yet another tax put on us for smoking cigarettes.  As an individual who pays for their own health insurance, doctor's fees, and other health care, it would be difficult to maintain all the other taxes imposed on us, but if giving an ultimatum on how money is spent, I would choose smoking.  As difficult as that is to believe, more taxes could potentially mean cutting out my own health care costs, which in turn could hurt the government even more until health care is mandated as I have had several thousands of dollars in medical bills even with health insurance.  The one thing that I do know is that my freedom for smoking will not be taken away until my own choosing.  As a taxpayer in the U.S., the government sets such high standards of what is right and wrong, but contradictions are present and in our faces since I, the taxpayer, pay for illegals and people who scam Medicaid and food stamps through use of my tax money.  If you want to use some of that money to benefit my family or myself by cutting heath care costs, then please tax away, but if those taxes will be used for yet another problem area in our society, then maybe another country has better offerings for the educated taxpayers in this country."

My father died from copd and my friend recently died from smoking related lung cancer. They were wonderful people who made, ( though unknown by the public), great contributions to society. My friend was once confronted and belittled by our nieghbor for being of Arab decent. I appologized for them and was extrremely upset. My friend explained that these bigots,( my term, not his), have to have the right to express themselves and not be isolated so that they can be a part of society and here contrary views in hopes of changing their views. If we isolate them they will only become more bitter and never get the chance to grow.  Now my government is isolating smokers like my friend. What a shame. I am very concerned by what we are doing to smokers and believe it is more hate and bigotry not the public good that is the driving force behind the regulations that smokers are being subjected to. Example: E V A is being added to cigarrettes to stop people from burning down the house. You are forcing people people to inhale a product used in mothballs and the glue in hot glueguns.

1349,FDA-2013-N-0521-0398,"Re: Docket No: FDA-2013-N-0521, Regulation of Menthol In Cigarettes & Smoked Tobacco ProductsThis comment is on behalf of the Board of Directors for the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT), in response to the invitation for public comment on menthol in cigarettes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), July 23rd, 2013. SRNT is the largest scientific organization dedicated to interdisciplinary nicotine and tobacco research from molecular to societal levels, with an international membership, many of whom have contributed to the scientific evidence on the effects of menthol added to cigarettes.SRNT recognizes that a thorough review of the scientific evidence on the effects of menthol was produced by FDA’s Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) and that on July 21, 2011 TPSAC voted to approve its final report and recommendations, which concluded, “removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the United States.”In addition, SRNT recognizes that FDA also subsequently produced an independent “Preliminary Evaluation of the Possible Public Health Effects of Menthol Versus Nonmenthol Cigarettes,” based on weighing the collective body of evidence for the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on public health. That report concluded that: “Consistent patterns have emerged as a result of FDA’s evaluation of the scientific evidence relevant to the impact of menthol tobacco products on public health. While there is little evidence to suggest that menthol cigarettes are more or less toxic or contribute to more disease risk to the user than nonmenthol cigarettes, adequate data suggest that menthol use is likely associated with increased smoking initiation by youth and young adults. Further, the data indicate that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with greater addiction. Menthol smokers show greater signs of nicotine dependence and are less likely to successfully quit smoking. These findings, combined with the evidence indicating that menthol’s cooling and anesthetic properties can reduce the harshness of cigarette smoke and the evidence indicating that menthol cigarettes are marketed as a smoother alternative to nonmenthol cigarettes, make it likely that menthol cigarettes pose a public health risk above that seen with nonmenthol cigarettes.” (FDA, July 23, 2013)The SRNT Board considers that the reviews of the evidence conducted by TPSAC and by FDA summarized above were thorough, balanced and that their conclusions are based on the best science available. We also note that since the publication of these reports, the more recent evidence that has been published has continued to be broadly consistent  with the conclusions of these reports (e.g. Faseru et al, 2013; Reitzel et al, 2013; Rojewski et al, 2013; D’Silva et al, 2012; Nonnemaker et al, 2013; Giovino et al, 2013).   Given the consistent conclusions from the TPSAC review, FDA’s own independent review and of subsequent studies published on menthol in peer-reviewed scientific journals over the past year, the SRNT Board makes the following recommendations:1.FDA should establish a tobacco product standard addressing menthol concentrations in all tobacco products intended to be smoked (i.e. all combusted tobacco products, cigars and tobacco rolling paper, and other menthol products intended for use to flavor tobacco). 2.The new menthol standard should entirely prohibit the sale of a smoked tobacco product containing any detectable menthol, or any other additive known to produce a menthol-like (cooling or anesthetic) sensory effect.3.The new menthol standard should be fully implemented within 12 months from the initial announcement.4.The new menthol standard should be combined with a public education campaign designed to educate the public about the new menthol standard, and to promote smoking cessation services for menthol smokers who want to quit smoking.5.The effects of the new menthol standard should be thoroughly evaluated using the best evaluation and research methods available, including surveillance for switching to non-combustible products and electronic cigarettes if the new menthol standard is not implemented for all tobacco products.We thank you for your consideration of these comments and recommendations and we would be honored to assist you in any way possible in formulating effect new standards for menthol in tobacco products."

1358,FDA-2011-N-0467-0015,"I can only specifically talk about e-cigarettes as that is my area of expertise.  I report on news surrounding the industry at a website I run www.SteveVape.com.  Because I follow news surrounding e-cigarettes very closely, I have some insight into reported usage of the devices by minors.  Anecdotally, according to a number of reports in the media and surveys administered by groups within the industry itself, e-cigarettes are not appealing to minors.  The primary market for these devices are older smokers who are seeking an alternative they feel is preferable to cigarettes.Some examples of reports showing minors have not adopted the technology include:http://magicvalley.com/news/local/battle-of-the-vapors/article_a99a7e8b-830c-592e-8858-21e64d12a473.htmlhttp://articles.boston.com/2011-09-30/yourtown/30230337_1_e-cigarettes-electronic-cigarettes-pall-mallhttp://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/2011/07/post_169.htmlhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/sr.aspx?sm=HrpzL8PN5cP366RWhWvCTjggiZM_2b8yQJHfwE9UXRNhE_3dFurthermore, I have interacted with a number of sellers of these devices.  None target minors in their advertising efforts nor willingly sell the devices to minors.  Most online vendors also require buyers verify their age prior to purchase.Additionally, regulation could potentially have the undesirable side-effect of putting small businesses out of business.  Many of the sellers of e-cigarettes are small operations that do not have physical storefronts.  Prohibiting non-face-to-face sales would be catastrophic to companies like this.Finally, media sites which cover the industry, much like my own, rely heavily on advertising within the industry.  The loss of the ability to sell advertising on these sites would also be catastrophic and result in a number of journalistic outlets being forced to shut down."

1364,FDA-2012-N-0143-0033,"  I am writing again on the crisis of vaping by middle and high school students, an article in the Washington Post Sept.23,2019, stated that Native American tribal officials and high school students spoke with the House Oversight Committee in July, 2019 , they testified that JUUL representatives actually came to their school talking to the students about how safe their JUUL products were. That company should be shut down, the only reason for their product is to MAKE MONEY. Why is the FDA waiting, I propose you have the CEO of Juul and all the company reps and their middle-school, and high school children go on TV and use the Juul vaping products, have them encourage their own teenagers to suck in the smoke real deep. I am so tired that no one in the government will step in and stop this NOW! All you do is talk about it. Just keep removing the tainted flour and Tyson chicken nuggets, that's what you do best. The addictive poison JUULs will keep being bought in the mean time. I am a registered nurse with 30 years experience,I don't take my lungs and being able to breathe for granted. Betty Faust"
1365,FDA-2009-N-0294-0422,"FOR FDA COMMENTSTATEMENT BY NARINDER DHALIWAL ON DANGERS OF HOOKAH TOBACCO AND  HOOKAH SMOKING One of the most troublesome issues in the area of flavored tobaccos is use and  sale of hookah tobacco. Hookah tobacco contains the same chemicals found in all tobacco, including nicotine.  It is being used extensively in the United States and elsewhere by many young people who are experimenting with it. The tobacco is smoked in water pipes and its fruit and candy flavors attract the 18-25 age group.  Flavors include apple, chocolate, strawberry, cola, kiwi and a variety of other flavors, including spiced and molasses. Hookah tobacco is purchased in blocks, ranging in price from $6.00-$12.00 or squares from $2.00-$4.00.  Secondhand hookah smoke contains the same cancer-causing particulates found in secondhand cigarette smoke.  In addition, the charcoal used in the tobacco heating process produces the toxin, carbon monoxide.  Former California State Director of Health, Dr. Diana Bonta warned:  “The use of hookah pipes is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. Smoking hookah pipes has been reported to cause oral, esophageal and lung cancer as well as heart disease, chronic bronchitis and of course, nicotine addiction.”  Flavored hookah tobacco needs to be regulated."

1370,FDA-2017-N-4678-0011,"See attached file(s)September 20, 2018Food and Drug AdministrationDivision of Dockets Management5630 Fishers Lane, Rm 1061Rockville, MD 20852Via https://www.regulations.govRe: Docket No. FDA-2017-N-4678-0001, RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP) ApplicationsDear Colleagues:I submit these comments as an expert in addiction and an investigator currently examining the potential impact of a policy that reduces the nicotine content of cigarettes to reduce the addiction potential of smoking.  My research in this topic area focuses on populations that are especially vulnerable to tobacco addiction (i.e., adults with co-morbid other substance use disorders, mental illness, and socioeconomic disadvantage)A consensus has emerged among experts in this topic area that to maximize the potential positive impact of a policy reducing the nicotine content of combusted tobacco products it should be implemented in a context where attractive alternative non-combusted tobacco products are readily available in the tobacco marketplace for those who are unable or currently unwilling to completely quit nicotine use (see pdf copies of Benowitz et al., 2017; Gottlieb & Zeller, 2017).  I concur with the conclusions reached in the RJ Reynolds applications that the overall relative health risks of using of the six Camel Snus products for which they are seeking MRTP status are indeed substantially less than those from using conventional tobacco cigarettes.  These products could be especially helpful as a reduced-risk combusted alternative source of nicotine in certain subpopulations of smokers who are especially vulnerable to tobacco use and addiction, including younger males, those residing in rural settings, those with co-morbid alcohol problems, those working in blue-collar occupations, and Native Americans (see pdf copies of Redner et al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2017; White et al., 2015).  The applicants appropriately acknowledge that these snus products are associated with substantial health risks, but considerably less than continuing to smoke cigarettes.  They indicate that they will include such information in advertisements for these products.  They also indicate that they will target these products to current smokers.  That all seems to be in keeping with the spirit of harm reduction outlined in FDAs Center of Tobacco Products Comprehensive Plan for Tobacco and Nicotine Regulation.  I do not submit this letter without some trepidation that conferring MRTP status to these snus products could result in a subset of never-tobacco-users perceiving them as safe and thus initiating use where under current policies they would not have done so.  However, that concern has to be balanced against the possibility that by withholding MRTP status a subset of current smokers who would have migrated from conventional cigarettes to snus had they understood that the latter were less harmful will not do so.  These are not easy decisions, but if we are going to implement the vision outlined in the Comprehensive Plan, these difficult decisions must be faced based on the best available scientific evidence.  My reading of such evidence leads me to support this application.  Sincerely,Stephen T. Higgins Ph.D.Director, University of Vermont Tobacco Center of Regulatory ScienceVirginia H. Donaldson Professor of Translational Science, Departments of Psychiatry and Psychological Science"

1380,FDA-2012-D-0071-1634,"It sickens me to know that in this modern age, when a wide range of testing methods are readily available, animals are still subject to painful, unnecessary and deadly laboratory treatments. The FDA's plans to use rats in a test demonstrating the reduced risk of new ingredients in tobacco products must be stopped. This inhumane practice is irrelevant to human smokers. There is absolutely no excuse for continuing with this plan when alternative and more accurate methods, such as testing on human cells or clinical studies with human smokers, can be just as easily performed. I do not and will NEVER support the tobacco industry. Tobacco is nothing more than a harmful substance to its users -- and no study, whether it includes animal testing or not, will change that fact. Labeling a tobacco product as having a 'reduced risk' is nothing more than a marketing ploy. Furthermore, tobacco inhalation will not affect the animals in the same way that it can be expected to affect humans; therefore, the animal testing is entirely irrelevant and wasteful. Do not subject these innocent animals to testing that will prove nothing. "

1424,FDA-2013-N-0521-0062,"As the former Sheriff of Stokes County and a current curriculum coordinator for Criminal Justice Technology at a North Carolina Community College, I keep a keen eye on developments in the criminal justice system.  I understand the interconnections in local, state, and federal law enforcement, judicial processes, corrections, and security services.  Each year, the state and federal government examine adjustments in criminal law.  I wanted to call your attention to an issue that might be overlooked or not fully considered. The FDA is studying whether to ban menthol cigarettes from the marketplace.  Therefore, criminalizing the sale and distribution of a currently legal product.   Our society knows smoking tobacco can be dangerous, but criminalizing menthol cigarettes might be taking it one step to far.  If banned, consumers desire for the product will not magically disappear.  Menthol cigarettes will simply be added to the underground market network for distribution that tends to involve organized crime and sophisticated distribution systems.  Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies realize the issue of tobacco smuggling is complex and intertwines with other criminal enterprises.  Thus, it places an increased burden on law enforcement agencies dealing with finite resources.A ban on menthol cigarettes would touch more than law enforcement agencies.  An illicit tobacco trade makes it much easier for minors to purchase illegal cigarettes because vendors who operate in the shadow of regulations seldom verify a customer’s age.  Furthermore, considerable tax revenues generated are lost and profits made by others are utilized to expand other criminal operations.The contraband tobacco trade is one of the most complex tobacco control issues because it is intertwined with other legal, policy and social concerns.  Therefore, it needs to be given careful consideration and examined from all the various perspectives including the secondary consequences if banned.  I would appreciate your consideration in this matter."

1462,FDA-2013-N-0521-0205,"Since the introduction of tobacco by colonial settlers in the late 1600’s, tobacco has been an integral part of North Carolina’s culture and economy.  It has helped our state and nation grow.   North Carolina is the center of the United States tobacco industry and production. However, tobacco has not been without controversy. As the FDA examines regulating menthol cigarettes, the decision should be formulated with all the various consequences and factors.  There are many financial and social issues to consider. Tobacco has a large financial impact on tax revenues in North Carolina.   In the most recent state revenue collections released in the middle of April, cigarette tax revenues amounted to $190 million for the first nine months.  While the revenue collections are down 6% from a comparable period in 2011, it is still very significant.  Menthol cigarettes are accountable for approximately one-third of cigarette sales.  Thus, if the FDA were to ban menthol cigarettes from the market, we would see a significant drop in future state revenue collections up to $60 million or more.On top of the vast tax revenue decrease, law enforcement agencies would have to deal with growth in the illegal trade of menthol cigarettes.  The demand will not disappear.  Consumers will seek out avenues to obtain them.  The high potential and low risk of contraband tobacco trade are especially appealing to criminal organizations with already established smuggling operations for other substances which can easily use existing contacts and resources to establish menthol cigarette opportunities.

1464,FDA-2015-N-1514-0134,"As a consumer, I support appropriate child-resistant packaging and appropriate safety warning labels in principle. However, I and my fellow members of CASAA strongly object to the deeming regulation that would effectively ban all e-cigarette products other than a handful of cigalikes. I personally quit smoking and have remained smoke-free thanks to other e-cigarette products; no possible benefits of the proposed rulemaking could possibly offset the damage to consumers and public health from the deeming regulation.As you know, nicotine, in the low concentrations found in e-cigarette liquid and smokeless tobacco products, is not very toxic. I have used open-system e-cigarettes and, like most consumers, have had accidental exposure to the liquid (e.g., spilling it on my hands), and have suffered no ill effects. All smoke-free e-cigarette products that I use, including e-liquid have come in child-proof containers. It is important to mention that I have many products in my home that pose greater accidental exposure hazard than the products in question, bleach and other cleaning products, for example.If refill liquid bottles were made too difficult to open or were made unattractive due to mandatory labeling or other restrictions, I would be much more likely to transfer the liquid into a different bottle.If the warning labels contain information that I know is false or misleading, that this would make me less likely to trust other information from the FDA or warning labels on other products"

1468,FDA-2012-N-0143-0055,"Dear Sir or Madam:On behalf of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association of the United States (FEMA), we appreciate the opportunity to submit comments in response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Harmful and Potentially Harmful Constituents in Tobacco Products; Established List; Proposed Additional; Request for Comments (84 Fed. Reg. 38032 (August 5, 2019)).  "
1469,FDA-2015-N-1514-0217,"Because electronic cigarettes and e-liquid are a rapidly growing hazard to public health, the FDA must require child resistant packaging for e-liquid products, and warning labels about the health risks of nicotine exposure on all e-liquid and e-cigarette products. Poison control calls regarding electronic cigarettes and e-liquid has surged over the past few years, from only 0.3% of tobacco-related calls in September 2014 to 41.7% in February 2014. This rapid increase in poison control calls indicates that e-liquid is a growing risk for children and adults alike (Chatham-Stephens et al., 2014). Compared to other tobacco-related poison control calls, e-cigarette exposures are more likely to cause negative health effects including vomiting, nausea, and eye irritation (Chatham-Stephens et al., 2014). The risks related to accidental nicotine exposure may even be fatal. The lethal dose for nicotine in adults is estimated to be between 30 and 60 mg, and the lethal dose for children may be as little as 10 mg. Given the varied nicotine concentrations in unregulated e-liquid, exposure to lethal levels of nicotine is an ever-present risk. Some retailers sell e-liquid with concentrations as high as 87 mg/mL, so even small amounts may result in fatal levels of accidental nicotine ingestion. In a recent study examining a convenience sample of 21 online e-cigarette retailers, 100% of the websites sold e-liquid at potentially fatal concentrations (Morris & Fiala, 2014). Electronic cigarette and e-liquid retailers are not voluntarily addressing these safety risks. Of the websites studied by Morris and Fiala (2014), only 59% mentioned the risks of nicotine exposure somewhere on their website, and only 29% mentioned hazards of nicotine poisoning on their home page. Only three of the websites (14%) mentioned using child resistant packaging on all of their products, despite the fact that young children are the most vulnerable to e-cigarette poisonings, accounting for 51.1% of all e-cigarette poison control calls (Chatham-Stephens et al., 2014). It is clear that without FDA regulation, not all e-cigarette retailers will add warning labels and child resistant packaging to e-cigarettes and e-liquid.Child resistant packaging (CRP) effectively prevents death and illness from harmful substances. CRP protects young children from accidental exposure to dangerous substances such as e-liquid. However, CRP is not childproof, and CRP alone is not a comprehensive solution to the danger of accidental exposure (Rodgers, 2002). Additionally, CRP does not address the danger that e-liquid poses to adults. Further regulation is needed to protect the public from exposure to e-liquid. Warning labels are another effective measure that decreases unsafe product use, and may prevent poisonings and deaths of individuals using e-liquid and e-cigarette products. Meta-analyses by Argo and Main (2004) found that warning labels increase safe behavior when using potentially dangerous products. These meta-analyses also found that consumers are more likely to pay attention to vivid warning labels, such as labels with graphics or bright colors, compared to plain labels. It is advisable for the FDA to require e-cigarette manufacturers to include a warning label on e-cigarette and e-liquid containers informing consumers of potential health risks from nicotine poisoning. Further, these warning labels should be a bright color, or have an eye-catching graphic on them in order to maximize how many consumers see and read these labels. Argo and Main (2004) also found that warnings on advertisements, posters, or signs are even better at attracting consumers' attention than warnings directly on a product. Consequently, it is advisable to require e-cigarette companies to include safety warnings in their promotional materials and advertisements as well as directly on products in order to reach the greatest number of consumers with risk information.

1470,FDA-2011-N-0467-0087,I work for a wholesale distributer.  Included in our product line are electronic cigarettes.  I believe that the FDA should ban sale of electronic cigarettes as well as all tobacco products from sale over the internet. Tobacco products should be sold only on a face to face basis from a local retailer to insure age verification. Internet sales companies do not support local communities the way that we and our retail customers do. Please protect our children and support local business by banning these cigarettes from internet sales. 
1471,FDA-2012-D-0071-1501,"I am a Integraive Medicine physician deeply concerned about the public health consequences of this guidance.  Human population studies, clinical intervention trials, and human-based cellular studies should remain the foundation of tobacco research.Animal studies were initially used to deny the smoking-lung cancer link. But decades of human epidemiology studies prove this link and other devastating effects tobacco has on human health.The Institute of Medicine says that it is not possible to make laboratory animals use tobacco products the way humans do, and there are inherent interspecies differences that prevent meaningful extrapolation of effects to humans.The self-addiction studies that FDA recommends be performed in animals, such as “place preference,” “drug discrimination,” and “self-administration” studies, are not only cruel, but tenuously linked to human behavior.Tobacco is inherently hazardous and poses serious risks to the user’s health and to the health of others. Testing more cigarettes, additives, and other tobacco products on animals will not protect public health.Please do not allow for testing on animals for modified tobacco products.  This will endanger more humans as the tobacco industry will then increase the market with newer products that we have been working hard to bring awareness to the dangers of smoking over the past few decades.  This will also unnecessarily cause more animals to be tested upon which also is uncalled for.I hope that the FDA will start taking a position on protecting the citizens of this country rather than following the lobbying efforts  of corporate tobacco companies."

After listening to today's retailers, importers and distributors comments, I want to add the following comments: 1) I am aware of litigation recently filed by major tobacco manufacturers challenging the First Amendment advertising restrictions incorporated into the FSPTCA. As the outcome of this lawsuit is unknown at this time, it would be a financial burden on my company to have to maintain BOTH color POS materials and black and white POS materials pending outcome of the lawsuit and potential issuance of an injunction. I ask that if an injunction is put in place and then later on lifted, a period of time be granted to small importers to be able to design new compliant advertising POS and remove the older, non-compliant POS materials.  2) Many of the proposed regulations under FSPTCA will prove to be a financial burden on small importers. Testing, ingredient reporting, packaging changes, advertising changes, etc. Under RFAA guidelines, FDA is required to review the impact of these proposed regulatory changes on small businesses like mine. I respectfully request FDA to keep this in mind and be empathetic to the limited resources small businesses have under present economic conditions in the USA. 3) My company purchases our tobacco blends overseas using a variety of domestic and imported tobaccos normally purchased through leaf dealers. Now FDA proposed regulations require importers to label their products indicating the percentage of foreign versus imported tobaccos in the blend. I request that FDA provide small importers like my company wide flexibility in their percentage's range of foreign versus domestic tobaccos used in the blends and reasonable time period to meet this new regulation.  It is often a difficult task for importers like myself to receive this type of information from overseas companies on a timely basis. These are my additional comments to today's listening session.

The new ‘Family Prevention and Tobacco Control Act’ is a good step in the right direction. Suffice it to say that with all the warnings on tobacco labels, advertisement on both the paper and the electronic media and various awareness programs, it is strange to know that people still turn deaf ears to the negative side effects of tobacco use. The rules have been laid down, hence I encourage and advice you not to leave any stone unturned in bringing to book any tobacco company that tries to undermine this great Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. One thing about the government is formulating a policy and another thing is implementing it.Tobaccos (smoke and smokeless) are all killer disease. I remember visiting a country where smokeless tobacco is like snacks to them. Report has it that so many people have died as a result of mouth cancer, yet, it does not debar them from chewing the same substance. As this new regulation comes into effect, I want to see the FDA limit the quantity of nicotine permitted in any tobacco product; completely eliminate every deadly flavor in connection with tobacco products and also carry out more awareness program on the dangers of tobacco use. It is strange to see people spend their hard earned money purchasing tobacco at the detriment of their health. Government should stop subsidizing tobacco farmers because their products are of no benefit to the public. Heavy penalties should be leveled against those retailers who break the rule by selling this stuff to minors. I learned that in most minority areas, tobacco products are sold cheaper than in other areas and this makes it easily accessible to every Tom, Dick and Harry, this calls for a quick action"

It is our belief that the single best way to differentiate between pipe tobacco and roll-your own is by length of cut in that pipe tobacco strands are usually under one inch and roll-you-own strands are significantly longer in order to hold the tobacco together in a tube or paper. Therefore we recommend that this be the standard as it is easily discernible visually. Mention of other pipe tobacco forms such as; flake, plug, twist, rope and disks should be accepted at face value as pipe tobacco.Background: Moisture content varies between English (non aromatic) and aromatic blends. Our experience indicates that 12%-14% moisture is ideal for all pipe tobacco. The suggestion that 22%+ is correct may be sufficient for some aromatic blends and some manufacturers but is very high.Not all blends contain Perique, Latakia or black cavendish. Many blends do not contain any of these tobaccos.We suggest that all moisturizing agents such as flavors, humidifiers and mold inhibitors be certified food grade.Laboratory testing is very expensive (estimated at circa $5,000 per blend) and laboratories are difficult to locate.

1532,FDA-2013-N-0521-0379,"Dear FDA Staff, I'm president of a 75-year-old company headquartered in Seymour, IN. We operate 29 convenience and tobacco stores in Indiana and Kentucky. We employ approximately 250 people. We responsilby sell tobacco products to adult customers and work diligently to comply with state and federal regulations regarding the sale of tobacco. If the sale of menthol cigarettes was banned in the US, a black market will emerge for menthol cigarettes. Illicit trade in lower taxed or even untaxed cigarettes already exists from state to state and a ban on menthol cigarettes will only provide a similar opportunity for criminal elements to establish a black market for menthol cigarettes. Fostering the illicit sale of menthol cigarettes will put the public at rist due to more illegal activity. Rather than protecting the public health, a balck market in menthol cigarettes puts the public in harms way as a result of more widespread organized crime. While retailers are on the front lines of preventing the sale of cigarettes to minors, the black market does not perate within the law or any sense of public responsibility. Instead of menthol cigarette sales taking place in licensed and regulated retail stores, a ban on menthol cigarettes will lead to smuggled menthol cigarettes being sold on the streets without black market profiteers being concerned with checking someone's identification to ensure that they are of legal age. Illegal sales of menthol cigarettes on the black market will undermine the FDA's goal of protecting public health. Overly restrictive regulations or a ban on the sale of menthol cigarettes will have a severe negative impact on retailers and wholesalers such as ourselves. A ban on menthol cigarette sales will result in a significant drop in legal cigarettes sales due to customers seeking out balck market menthol cigarettes. This will put more jobs at risk and even the prospect of business closures. The result is lost jobs, lost cigarette tax revenue to state governments and the federal government and greater expenditures by law enforcement officials to combat what will be a widespread black market in menthol cigarettes. Banning menthol will trade good paying, legal jobs with illegal jobs created by a rampant black market with no resulting benefit to the public health. Please protect our 75-year-old company, our 250 employees and our future. Sincerely, Andrea S. Myers President, Kocolene Marketing, LLC"

1543,FDA-2012-N-0143-0031,"The vaping community as a whole believes that a change is needed in the vaping industry, and it is needed quickly!Before we begin, please keep in mind that we see things from the perspective of a 2-pack-a-day adult smoker that made the switch to vaping, then went on to help thousands of others quit smoking and dipping traditional tobacco through the education of risk reduction in regards to vaping as an alternative to tobacco products. Most vapes you local vape shops. Those shops will close and citizens will lose their jobs.  Most of us are also parent's so we see whats going on from both inside the vaping industry, as well as from a parents perspective.So we are asking today, how do we find solutions to the issues that currently cloud the billion dollar vaping industry?We would like to suggest the following action be taken:I. The creation and formation of the National Committee on Vaping Policy and Regulation (NCVPR). This committee will be comprised of the most prominent experts in the vaping industry and will become a separate branch within the framework of the FDA and will encompass all products directly related to vaping, including vaping products containing THC where THC products are legal. This will help put an end to the unjust regulations that are currently being imposed on vaping retail stores and manufacturers, as well as establish vaping as being a separate entity from tobacco, and will instead edit and use the policies and regulations the FDA attempted to create, but was severely limited due to time constraints and limited resources.II. Currently, vape retail stores receive required warnings on vaping from the state and local comptrollers. In addition to the formation of the NCVPR, We would also like to see the comptroller be in charge of placing an Electronic Age Verification System in each physical vape retail store, as well as stricter age verification software standards for online sales. Under this system, the NCVPR will set standards for where Adult Approved Vaping Devices and Products can be sold. In order to reduce the associated risk of being more available to underaged teens and children, these vape retail stores should not be approved to be contained within a convenience store, nor should they be contained in a supermarket; as stand-alone vaping retail employees are able to provide specialized instruction and education to potential and current vape consumers. This restriction to stand-alone retail stores also allows a one-on-one, more personalized experience between the salesperson and the customer. This, in turn, allows the salesperson to provide the correct product for the customer, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach that is currently plaguing the industry with pod-based systems sold in convenience stores and supermarkets. Again, thank you for acknowledging vaping as an acceptable alternative to traditional tobacco products. While the suggestions that we have listed are not perfect and do require fine-tuning before possible implementation, we do believe that they are necessary in order to create an open dialogue between the vaping community and the policy makers that are concerned for the safety and well-being of fellow American citizens just as much as we are. We must learn to work together in order to protect not only the children of our great nation, but also those who have been taken advantage of for the sole purpose of turning a profit.

1546,FDA-2013-N-0521-0393,"November 15, 2013Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305)Food and Drug Administration5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061Rockville, MD 20852.Re:  Docket No. FDA-2013-N-0521 (Menthol in Cigarettes)Dear FDA Representative:This letter is being submitted in response to the Food and Drug Administration’s “Advance Notice of Rulemaking” regarding the use of menthol in cigarettes.  The comments in this letter are being submitted on behalf of our company and its employees regarding the question of whether the FDA should regulate menthol in cigarettes.One of our major concerns with a question posed by the FDA in the Advance Notice of Rulemaking” is the possibility of a ban on the sale of menthol cigarettes.  In response to the question, clearly an illicit market for menthol cigarettes would arise if the FDA banned the sale of menthol cigarettes.Illicit tobacco markets are pervasive today and are mainly due to unreasonably high cigarette tax rates at the local and state levels.  A high tax environment creates the perfect conditions for black market sales of cigarettes.  If FDA imposes overly restrictive regulations on menthol in cigarettes or bans the sale of the product altogether, the conditions will be ripe for black market criminals to fill the on-going demand for mentholated cigarettes.Such a black market would further strain the limited resources of local, state and even federal law enforcement authorities.  Federal and state law enforcement efforts already are stretched to respond to the current level of crime, let alone a whole new wave of black market cigarette activity.  The FDA needs to be sensitive to the very real likelihood of fostering illegal cigarette sales if a ban on menthol cigarettes is proposed and subsequently adopted.  Moreover, contraband markets have a negative effect on public health because they undermine efforts to prevent underage smoking.  There is no way to monitor whether illicit cigarettes are sold to underage youths and black market sellers are unconcerned about asking for photo identification before making a sale. An outright prohibition on the sale of menthol cigarettes would have a severe impact on our company, our employees and the retail sector of the economy as well.  Many thousands of working Americans, including Farner-Bocken employees, rely on the sale of menthol cigarettes for their jobs as do so many manufacturing employees and workers in the retail industry.   A black market would drain legal sales of cigarettes away from law-abiding retailers and wholesalers only to allow criminals to profit from the underground sale of menthol cigarettes.These predictions of the negative consequences resulting from a ban on the sale of menthol cigarettes come from experience.  Wholesalers already face underground market competition in many product areas.  Besides the lost wholesale and retail jobs, the consequences of a menthol ban would extend to lost tax revenues for the federal, state and local governments.  Where will these governments make up the shortfall in tax revenue as a result of a nationwide black market?  Banning menthol cigarettes is an unreasonable policy position that will only lead to widespread illicit trade and crime at the expense of licensed wholesalers and retailers.  More importantly, a prohibition of menthol cigarettes may likely have an unintended negative impact on the public health, something the FDA is tasked with protecting.Sincerely yours,Paul FrancisFarner-Bocken Company"
1547,FDA-2011-N-0467-0073,"To Whom It May Concern,My name is Rebecca Maisel, and I am a partial owner and full-time employee of a company that manufactures and imports electronic cigarettes. I am writing to respectfully urge FDA to impose regulations requiring face-to-face sales of electronic cigarettes. Based on various studies published world-wide, there is no question that electronic cigarettes pose a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes. With that said, even a cursory review of available retail outlets on the web reveals a clear lack of regard for the safety of minors under the age of 18 (or 19 in some states) with respect to electronic cigarette purchases. Although e-cigs are a safer alternative, they still contain nicotine. It is well-known that age verification methods online are ineffective. Thus, currently minors can easily attain electronic cigarettes containing nicotine online. Being involved in the electronic cigarette industry, I can personally attest to the fact that the race to brick-and-mortar retailers is well underway. There currently exists abundant availability of a wide range of e-cig brands at retail outlets throughout the U.S. Indeed, adults of majority age who choose to purchase electronic cigarettes will continue to have the opportunity to do so should FDA ban remote or online sales of these products. In the alternative, if FDA chooses not to outright ban online sales of electronic cigarettes, FDA should at a minimum heavily regulate the online sale of electronic cigarettes, requiring online retailers to have strict age verification policies, among other regulations intended to deter and prevent minors from purchasing e-cigs online. In addition to increasing the safety of minors, a ban of online sales would show FDA's support for traditional retail business, many of which are run by small business owners who are employing Americans in their stores nationwide. As I see it, there is no downside to removing or heavily regulating online sales of e-cigs. Thank you."

1570,FDA-2013-N-0521-0417,"November 21, 2013Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305)Food and Drug Administration5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061Rockville, Maryland 20852RE:Docket No. FDA-2013-N-0521Menthol in cigarettes (and other tobacco products)The North Dakota Tobacco Prevention and Control Advisory Committee submits this comment in response to the FDA’s Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 78 Fed. Reg. 44484 (July 24, 2013), to support a ban on menthol in cigarettes and other tobacco products.We request that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assert its authority to require the immediate removal of menthol from all cigarettes, and other tobacco products. Menthol is a flavoring, and like other flavorings added to tobacco, masks the harshness of tobacco on the mouth and throat.  This masking is very important in addicting new users, labeled by the tobacco industry as “replacement smokers.”  Because more than 80 percent of all current adult smokers started before age 18, menthol in tobacco is a pediatric health issue, according to the latest Surgeon General’s Report.Removing menthol from cigarettes is one of the most effective actions the FDA can take to improve the public’s health, and pediatric health in particular.  Menthol flavoring in cigarettes plays a major role in increasing youth initiation of smoking and in making smoking appealing to new and current smokers, especially among some racial and ethnic groups targeted by the advertising of menthol tobacco brands.  In 2009, Congress and the President recognized the role of flavoring in promoting tobacco use when it banned all flavored cigarettes such as grape, orange, strawberry, coffee, clove, vanilla, and chocolate – but exempted menthol.The FDA needs to include menthol in its list of flavorings banned in cigarettes for the above reasons.  To ensure that any FDA action banning menthol is not circumvented, the FDA should also:•Prohibit menthol as an additive at any level.•Prohibit menthol in all tobacco products, not just in cigarettes.•Ban menthol analogs and substitutes in all tobacco products to ensure that the FDA’s ban on menthol does not result in use of unregulated menthol-like alternatives that serve the same purposes as menthol (masking, youth appeal).•Promote appropriate cessation approaches for current menthol users to quit all tobacco products, rather than to switch from a menthol product to a new tobacco product.The evidence is clear.  The tobacco industry has a long and well documented history of marketing mentholated brands of cigarettes to new and current users, especially in racial and ethnic populations. The tobacco industry also has a long and well documented history of adapting to bypass the regulation.  Please act swiftly to regulate menthol flavoring in all tobacco products, in a way that ensures all current and future tobacco products are not modified to be palatable and appealing to new, young users.  Thank you for your prompt consideration of these comments and requests to regulate menthol.Sincerely, Nathan MarionNathan Marion, ChairWith approval from the North Dakota Tobacco Prevention and Control Advisory Committee.

In foreign countries, these international companies are known to be molting into variations of their pernicious selves; they are considered persons.By all appearances, the FDA would be ignoring the wisdom of follow the money. Changes to what tobacco companies can make, market and promote should not be altered or added to their already lethal array of brands.

1577,FDA-2009-N-0294-0303,"I believe that the H.R. 1256, The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act intent and details include the right amount of information to prevent smoking for 17 and younger people. The laws and regulations made from the H.R. 1256 are what is needed for tobacco companies to go by so their advertisement and marketing isn't intended for 17 and younger people. I feel when the statistics are looked at many 17 and younger people are non- smokers compared to 18 an older people who are former and current smokers. Because of the strict rules and regulations many tobacco companies avoid advertising to minors. Although this is good, I feel not enough is done to prevent 18 an older people from smoking. Currently, 21.89% adults over the age 18 are smokers. Men especially, who are the higher percentage of current smokers, are thrown into the tobacco advertisement market by magazines, entertainment events, and just the whole persona of a cigarette smoker. I believe that if the H.R. 1256 had more regulations for the everyone, not just minors, less people in the United States would be smokers. Even though tobacco manufacturers have a Use Fee that fully funds the FDA, I feel with more rules and determination a less percentage of Americans will be smokers."

1579,FDA-2013-N-0521-0040,"I feel that there should be no level of menthol in cigarettes. The menthol is in cigarettes to attract consumers, as it is a taste and flavor that customers enjoy. It has been proven in numerous studies that cigarettes can cause serious health problems, so by allowing menthol to remain in cigarettes, we are essentially promoting its use, and thus leading to more adverse events, putting an even larger burden on our already out of control health care costs for the nation. There shouldn’t be any flavor of any kind in any tobacco product. Again, why as a country are we endorsing products that have been proven to cause death and other serious medical conditions? FDA’s mission statement is to protect public health, and how can you sell someone tobacoo products and claim that your still protecting their health? It’s impossible. The FDA also regulates the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products to reduce tobacco use by minors. Flavors are attracting to minors, and should not be allowed in tobacco products, as it just makes the idea more enticing to them.I am a pharmacist, and I think it is absolutely preposterous that tobacco products are even still on the market, let alone products with menthol for flavor. Why aren’t tobacco products regulated like drugs are? If a drug had the long list of proven side effects like all tobacco products do, it would be pulled from the market, and the pharmaceutical company would undoubtedly face litigation. I refuse to sell cigarettes to patients in the pharmacy. As a pharmacist, it is my duty to promote the health and wellbeing of my customers, very similar to the role of the FDA. How can I sell something to my customers when I know that it’s unsafe? Health care costs in this country continue to rise, and adverse events from tobacco products are a huge chunk of those costs. These health care costs are preventable, but they’re not being prevented in part because the government isn’t doing everything in their power to help. Menthol and other flavoring should not be allowed in cigarettes. It’s bad enough that tobacco products are sold to begin with. If we as a country really care about protecting public health, we need to step up and make appropriate decisions. Banning menthol and other flavors can be a huge first step in that process, and lead to a healthier country, with less preventable health care costs. Thank you for your time."

1597,FDA-2009-D-0524-0029,"The proposal for providing a draft for industries when listing tobacco ingredients is needed. It is important that all industries are following the same guidelines when listing the tobacco ingredients. It will help the consumer be aware of the choices they are making when purchasing products that contain tobacco. The draft should be easy for industries to be able to follow along with an exact format for listing the ingredients. The opposing view to providing a draft for all tobacco industries to use is some may already have a guideline implemented. The industries should be given an adequate amount of time to be able to switch over to the proposed draft if it is passed. I am wondering what the impact will be on industries if the draft is provided? Also, how long will it take for these companies to receive the guidelines so they can start working on implementing them for their products? I don not see any disadvantages that could be associated with this. The only one that may affect the industry is consumers will start to realize all of the ingredients in tobacco and sales will plummet. This is bad for the tobacco industry for sales but good for public health purposes. The draft that is going to be proposed will allow for the consumers to be well aware of what they are putting into their bodies. That is why I believe the idea of a draft for listing ingredients should be well worth the time. Overall, the guidance document is a way for the FDA to be able to sort through the ingredients in a more timely manner to make sure they comply with the guidelines. Right now, the guidelines apply for smokeless tobacco and cigarettes but it is necessary to expand the guidelines to other tobacco products. There is an increase usage of e-cigarettes, hookah, and cigars that should contain the necessary ingredients listed so that consumers are able to identify the harmful ingredients they contain. "

Animal studies were initially used to deny the smoking-lung cancer link. But decades of human epidemiology studies prove this link and other devastating effects tobacco has on human health.The Institute of Medicine says that it is not possible to make laboratory animals use tobacco products the way humans do, and there are inherent interspecies differences that prevent meaningful extrapolation of effects to humans.

I have not seen a single ingredient on a bottle and who knows what is in the liquid. I would like to see more than a child resident cap. What prevents a kid from picking up the vape pen and smoking the poison.  At least with a traditional cigarette somebody has to perform several steps before a cigarette is lit. My mother died from cancer and it was associated with smoking and the lack of tobacco education. We know the dangers associated with traditional tobacco and we must treat the liquid nicotine the same way. Many countries have banned liquid nicotine and vape pens. In addition to liquid Nicotine we must regulate the other liquids being sold for the vape pens. I urge you enact strict regulations and hold the manufactures and distributors accountable for any and all negative health effect this poison may have with people. I also believe that the liquid should be placed behind the counters and you must be 18 to purchase the liquid. In addition warning labels should be affixed to the container. How do we stop a kid from taking a bottle of liquid nicotine to school and sharing it with his friends.  I also think that the bottles should have a way to meter the amount of liquid being dispensed to help prevent to much liquid from being dispensed at one time. If a kid was to accidently get a hold of a bottle and it is safeguarded with a meter  it could possibly prevent a kid from ingesting a lot of nicotine.  I am thinking something like a dropper tip that will dispense a small amount at a time. This would prevent a kid from taking a bottle and ingesting the entire bottle or pouring it in his friends drink.

I am a Nurse Practitioner and I am also a tobacco dependence treatment specialist. I work in an adolescent health center and counsel young people who are trying to quit smoking. We developed a program called iQuit which uses podcasting and text messaging to assist young people to quit. In the process of data collection about their smoking habits we found that 80% of the young people who we saw had smoked tobacco in a “hookah” or water pipe. This is more than those who used other forms of tobacco by far. The FDA ruling “… establishes a tobacco product standard special rule for cigarettes that states in part:…a cigarette or any of its component parts (including the tobacco, filter, or paper) shall not contain, as a constituent (including a smoke constituent) or additive, an artificial or natural flavor (other than tobacco or menthol) or an herb or spice, including strawberry, grape, orange, clove, cinnamon, pineapple, vanilla, coconut, licorice, cocoa, chocolate, cherry, or coffee, that is a characterizing flavor of the tobacco product or tobacco smoke.This standard applies to all tobacco products that meet the definition of a “cigarette” in section 900(3) of the Act even if they are not labeled as “cigarettes” or are labeled as cigars or as some other product.This ruling neglects to mention hookah tobacco which uses those same flavorings in tobacco products and is increasingly appealing to young people in high school and college. These young people are not aware that hookah smoking exposes them to the same carbon monoxide, tar and nicotine as cigarettes.

Box 14433Stanford, CA 94309November 13, 2013Food and Drug AdministrationDivision of Dockets Management (HFA-305)5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061Rockville, MD 20852RE:Docket No.: FDA-2013-N-0521-0079Dear Commissioners,1.  Should FDA consider establishing a tobacco product standard for menthol in menthol cigarettes? If so, what allowable level of menthol (e.g., maximum or minimum) would be appropriate for the protection of the public health?A proposed ban on mentholated cigarettes, without further consideration of alternative regulatory approaches, might preclude the possibility of permanently ending cigarette related deaths.  Specifically, were the government to regulate tobacco by requiring that the level of nicotine be reduced to non-addictive levels in cigarettes, mentholated cigarettes—precisely because they are associated with increased smoking—may aid smokers in their quest to overcome nicotine addiction and possibly preventing others from acquiring it.  Because the statutorily mandated Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee’s (TPSAC) report does not consider the effect of menthol in such below threshold level cigarettes, any such regulation banning mentholated cigarettes would be premature and could end up doing more harm than good in terms of protecting public health.  The FDA’s Advance Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking (re a tobacco product standard for menthol in menthol cigarettes) follows the publication of the TPSAC report on the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on public health.  In this report, TPSAC concludes that the availability of menthol cigarettes does have certain negative effects—such as increasing initiation of smoking or reducing the success of cessation—but does not have a significant effect on risk for disease outcomes.  According to TPSAC, the resultant increase in the prevalence of smoking would represent a negative public health impact.An Alternate Approach: Non-Addictive CigarettesNon-addictive cigarettes are obviously feasible; tobacco companies have occasionally produced and marketed them.  A large percentage of smokers report that they would like to quit  and would naturally opt, in their attempt to quit, for the non-addictive cigarette option.  Extrapolating from the findings of TPSAC, mentholated cigarettes would similarly make the smoking of tobacco cigarettes, containing below addiction levels of nicotine, more palpable.  A regulation that bans mentholated cigarettes would most likely result in reducing the efficacy of any attempts to reduce the level of nicotine in cigarettes below addiction level.In 1994, an article was published in the New England Journal of Medicine that proposed reducing the amount of nicotine in cigarettes as a way to avert addiction.  Neal L. Benowitz & Jack E. Henningfield, Establishing a Nicotine Threshold for Addiction: The Implications for Tobacco Regulation, 331 New Eng. J. Med. 123, 124-25 (1994).  According to this article’s authors, studies have shown that 5 mg of nicotine per day is a threshold level that can readily establish and sustain addiction.  They further conclude: “assuming that the estimated target daily dose of nicotine should be 5 mg or less to avert addiction and that a young person may smoke up to 30 cigarettes per day, one can conclude that a maximal available (i.e. systemic) dose of 0.17 mg of nicotine per cigarette is the threshold level for a less-addicting cigarette.”Under the Act, the FDA has the power to establish “tobacco product standards,” § 907, including “provisions, where appropriate, for nicotine yields of the product.”  § 907(a)(4)(A)(i).  The only limitation on this power is that the FDA may not issue a regulation “requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero.”  § 907(d)(3)(B).  In theory, the agency can set the level of nicotine allowed in cigarettes at such a level that addiction would be greatly decreased.  If menthol was able to aid in making these cigarettes more attractive—that is to say, if menthol does in fact increase the likelihood that smokers will continue to smoke—it will aid in the transition from addictive to non-addictive cigarettes.  In such a situation, menthol as an additive would reduce the demand for contraband nicotine-rich cigarettes by possibly keeping smokers satisfied with their reduced nicotine cigarettes.  In any case, TPSAC does not consider the effect of menthol in cigarettes with nicotine levels below the threshold level for addiction.  The study does not address whether or not menthol has anesthetic, counterirritant, or other attractive properties to such an extent that a very low nicotine but mentholated cigarette would still satisfy at least those smokers that are looking to quit. For this reason, the study’s conclusions must be viewed with suspicion."

1644,FDA-2013-N-0521-0395,"See attached Re:Docket No. FDA-2013-N-0521 Menthol in CigarettesThe following is submitted in response to the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FDA-2013-N-0521) with regard to banning, or tightly regulating, menthol-flavored cigarettes. The FDA should give careful consideration to the risks of illicit-market activity as a result of whatever action it takes, and to additional actions that might control those risks.When it instructed the FDA to consider a ban on menthol cigarettes in the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, Congress also instructed the FDA to consider the illicit-market problem.  Neither the TPSAC report on menthol  nor this year’s FDA report   does so adequately.The problem is not a minor one. Of course illicit markets reduce the benefits of controls by facilitating evasion. But they also create their own health harms, social harms, and budget costs. As the illicit drug markets demonstrate, those harms can be large. One potential supply route for illicit menthol cigarettes might be across the U.S.-Mexican border, where violent multinational organized crime groups dominate drug smuggling.Peter Reuter has pointed out that a ban on cigarettes, which would surely reduce smoking, would also create a substantial illicit market, and that the gains from smoking reduction need to be weighed against the costs of illicit markets.  In a new paper (attached), Angela Hawken, Jonathan Kulick, and James Prieger extend that point by analyzing the ways in which taxes and regulations can also generate systematic evasion, with qualitatively similar side effects.  The size of the illicit market that might arise in the face of a menthol ban depends on many unknowns about supply of various kinds (domestic illicit production, overseas illicit production, smuggling, and retailing) and demand. It is possible but not certain that many current menthol smokers would resort to “home mentholation” of non-menthol cigarettes. The size of the illicit market also depends on related policy choices, including the regulation of products such as flavored e-cigarettes that might compete with illicit menthol cigarettes.  There is already a substantial market in tax-evaded cigarettes; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives [BATFE] estimates total taxes evaded at $10 billion per year.  That illicit activity does not currently receive proportionate enforcement attention; BATFE, the primary federal enforcement agency in this domain, spends less than 2 percent of its budget on tobacco enforcement.  A ban on menthol cigarettes would be expected to add to illicit-market demand, to an extent that has not yet been estimated but which might be considerable. Total licit-market retail sales of menthol cigarettes have been estimated at $26B in 2010,  larger than the market for any illicit drug except for cannabis and cocaine.  Menthol smokers report strong attachment to menthol; in surveys, more than a third say they would quit rather than switch to non-menthol product.  The success rate in quit attempts is not high in general, and (as noted by TPSAC) may be even lower for menthol smokers.  So it is not possible to rule out the risk that a menthol ban would create a large number of unsuccessful quitters seeking illicit supplies.A menthol ban, even if imperfectly observed, could nevertheless reduce smoking prevalence and thus smoking-related health damage. In order to reach a judgment as to whether a menthol ban would be, on balance, beneficial or harmful to health and other values, gains from reduced smoking would have to be weighed against the losses from expanding the illicit markets. But even with more facts and analysis about illicit demand and supply than are currently in hand, it would not be possible to estimate the benefits and costs of a menthol ban without specifying the accompanying enforcement regime in terms of resources, tactics, and penalties. Timing matters: because of positive-feedback effects in rates of illicit activity,  increasing enforcement before increasing illicit-market demand by banning menthol would be expected to produce better outcomes than increasing demand first and then trying to enforce against an already-swollen market. Any move toward a ban ought to be undertaken in consultation with the federal agencies charged with enforcement against illicit tobacco-related activities (BATFE, ATTTB, CBP, FBI), with state and local law-enforcement agencies and Native American governments, and with foreign governments, especially those of Canada and Mexico.I would be happy to answer any questions, and to work with FDA staff toward getting this important decision right.Sincerely yours,Mark A.R. Kleiman"
1645,FDA-2009-N-0294-0009,"It has been well established over the past several decades that nicotine is an aggressively addictive drug, providing a general sense of well-being. Though subdued this sense of well-being, along with the physiological impact of addiction, are powerfully influential on the smoker's life.

However, the time has come for severe and uncompromising controls that can and will be effectively enforced.

It is abundantly clear that FDA should use its authority to ban use of menthol in all tobacco products.  The scientific record shows that the use of menthol in cigarettes increases the likelihood that children experimenting with smoking will become addicted, that the sale of menthol cigarettes amounts to tobacco addiction racism reflected in the racial and ethnic groups targeted and reached with the industry's promotional campaigns.  As no other flavorings are allowed in such products, menthol, the most pernicious, is overdue for a ban.  This should be matched with strict penalties for US sale of mentholated tobacco products and substantial government surveillance resources to detect import violations.  I am sure that with the new health care law, the government's projected savings in health care costs will also be substantial if such rules are promulgated and enforced.Barry Castleman, ScDEnvironmental Consultantbarry.castleman@gmail.com"

1669,FDA-2015-N-1514-0230,Instituting such type of regulations are warranted and aim to protect children from being harmed.

1671,FDA-2009-N-0294-0058,"Actually I wish to comment on FSC (Fire Safe Content) cigarettes and the NFPA's (National Fire Prevention Association's) drive to force cigarette manufacturers to produce only FSC type cigarettes. NFPA is successfully coercing state governments, cigarette producers, and attempting to coerce the federal government to enact legislation to make all cigarettes of the FSC type. While they are well-meaning in their intentions, they are exceedingly narrow-minded in their approach. They have their sights set on reducing fires caused by smoking materials, claiming that 700 to 900 people per year die by fires caused by smoking materials. I have little reason to dout those figures, they have done their research in so far as they have gone.The problem I have with their campaign is that there are 60 million smokers in the US, and not a shred of research has been done that I can locate on how the introduction of FSC cigarettes affects the behaviour and/or habits of smokers.Recently the brand I smoke has implemented the FSC program. (I was unaware of this program prior to now.) My cigarettes started going out while I was smoking them, as I do not puff at them constantly. Relighting them caused the burnt tip to flare up like a tiki torch, I've singed my mustache a couple of times trying to relight them. As I went into my second pack I realized that to keep them lit, I had to keep puffing on them. By puffing away like this, I started getting more smoke faster than I really desired it. You get used to this fairly quickly, but then I noticed my craving for cigarettes was increasing, I was smoking them more often.It seem to me that if this is the manner in which I reacted to my introduction to FSC cigarettes, there are potentially 60,000,000 other smokers in the USA that are going to have similar reactions, and similar behaviour modification induced by FSC cigarettes. The FSC cigarettes are actually ramping up my addiction to tobacco.FSC cigarettes are more addictive by virtue of the fact that you have to keep puffing on them to keep them lit. That makes it harder for people who want to quit to actually do so. Consequently, NFPA is actually pushing to legislate tobacco manufacturers to produce a more lethal and addictive product than they were previously producing with non-FSC cigarettes. Whereas I'm sure the tobacco companies don't mind being forced to produce a more addictive form of cigarette (sales will go up), no studies of which I am aware have been conducted to determine either the short or long term effects on smokers who use these new FSC products. As the new regulating agency of tobacco products, I believe you have a firm responsibility to intervene. Studies of the effects of FSC cigarettes on smokers, the toxicity of increased inhalation and changes in smoking habits associated with these FSC products need to be monitored to determine the additional risk factors that FSC cigarettes pose.While it is a noble thing to desire to save people's lives from fires, it is not so noble if you are condemming a million or so people to accelerated lung and heart disease and untimely deaths just for the sake of saving a few hundred from fires. We are talking about forcing a change in the smoking habits of 60 MILLION Americans without a single consideration for their health and well being, without a single study to determine the consequences of what FSC cigarettes will do to THEM. All NFPA cares about is the fire prevention statistics and 700 to 900 people a year, and that is their only justification, their only focus.There once was a drug called thalidomide. It worked very well at targeting the morning sickness symptoms of pregnant women. They really didn't do enough research before it was distributed. Those who do not learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. I'm just requesting that you please, please take this very seriously. Do the research on FSC cigarettes and their affects on smokers being introduced to them for the first time, both psychological and physical. Don't let a few politically active zealots create another tragedy involving millions of lives on a misguided quest to save a few.Sincere Best Regards,Arnold James Barzydlo, Electronic Technician for the US Postal ServiceAmateur string theorist, http://www.collidingstrings.orgabarzydlo@neb.rr.com"

1684,FDA-2009-D-0524-0014,"In accordance with the notice published at 74 Fed. Reg. 56842 (Nov. 3, 2009), Japan Tobacco International, a tobacco product manufacturer, and its subsidiary JT International, U.S.A., Inc. a tobacco product importer (referred to collectively as JTI) submit the following comments to the FDA docket regarding the Draft Guidance for Industry on Listing of Ingredients in Tobacco Products (Draft Guidance) pursuant to § 904(a)(1) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is to be commended for providing Draft Guidance to assist tobacco product manufacturers and importers in complying with FDCA § 904(a)(1).  JTI offers the following suggestions for clarifying the Draft Guidance, improving its commercial feasibility, and making it more consistent with the statute in its final form.  Most importantly, JTI requests that FDA extend the deadline for reporting ingredient information due to the great complexity of complying with the reporting methodology proposed by FDA.A.Definition of Importer (Section III.A.2)The Draft Guidance defines “importer” as “the owner or consignee at the time of entry of a tobacco product into the United States.”  JTI requests that FDA amend this definition to exclude products intended for export.  Without such a clarification, tobacco products that “enter” the United States only temporarily and are not intended for consumption in the United States may become subject to ingredients reporting requirements.  This includes duty-free products that must be consumed outside the United States and products that are solely in transit, destined for sale or consumption in other nations.  Reporting the ingredients of such products would be inconsistent with the purpose of FDCA, which is to protect American tobacco product consumers.B.Reporting of Tobacco (Section III.C.3(a))In other jurisdictions that have enacted ingredient reporting requirements, such as the European Union, Canada, and the State of Texas, tobacco is simply reported as “tobacco.”  The Draft Guidance requests that tobacco product manufacturers distinguish types of tobacco included in their products according to cure method, and requests additional unique identifying information including genetic or transgenic manipulation, and type, grade, or quality.  Tobacco product manufacturers generally do not have this information, which is determined by tobacco farmers.  The final guidance should clarify that tobacco product manufacturers are only required to provide manufacturing specifications such as the percentage or the type of tobacco (e.g. Burley, Virginia, Oriental), and other properties of naturally-derived materials that the manufacturer has specified in its supply contracts (similar to the distinction for complex materials “made to specifications,” discussed below).  JTI further requests that FDA adopt the international standard of reporting all tobacco as simply “tobacco.”C.Complex Material Reporting (Section III.C.3(b))The Draft Guidance divides complex materials into two groups – those that are made to the tobacco product manufacturer’s specifications and those that are not – and provides different reporting methods for the two groups.  There is no definition of “made to your specifications,” however.  JTI requests that FDA clarify the distinction between the two groups of complex materials.For complex materials that are not made to the tobacco product manufacturer’s specifications, the Draft Guidance states that the FDA expects the reporting entity to provide the name of the manufacturer of the complex material, and a uniquely identifying item name and/or number used by that manufacturer.  Though some of these suppliers may independently report the individual chemicals and naturally-derived materials in their complex materials to FDA, JTI would prefer, when possible, to report the individual ingredients of these complex materials directly to FDA to ensure consistency in reporting.  This is customary for other jurisdictions requiring ingredients disclosure, including the European Union.  The final guidance should clarify that tobacco product manufacturers have the option to report ingredients on behalf of their suppliers.The Draft Guidance also requires reporting the manufacturer of complex materials, whether or not they are made to specifications.  It is customary to have multiple suppliers for some complex materials, so JTI requests clarification as to how multiple suppliers of the same material should be reported to FDA.D.Ingredient Quantity and Reaction Products (Section III.C.3(c) and Section III.C.5)Section III.C.3(c)Section III.C.3(c) states that ingredients added by the tobacco product manufacturer include materials “known or reasonably expected to be formed through a chemical reaction during tobacco product manufacturing,” and such reaction products should be included in the ingredient listing.  It is impossible to report reaction products “added by the manufacturer” because chemical reactions formed during the manufacturing process are not only dependent on what is added to the tobacco but also dependent on the tobacco leaves used.  Tobacco leaf, being an agricultural product, will have different physical and chemical properties as a result of differences in soil nutrient content and climate. Analytical monitoring to further capture these naturally occurring variations to leaf during each step of the manufacturing process would require the establishment and implementation of analytical tools and new isolation methodologies that do not currently exist in the industry for consistent accuracy.Thus, JTI requests that the final guidance clarify that the requirement in Section III.C.3(c) to report reaction products refers only to reaction products that the manufacturer specifically intends to be produced and thereby added to the product.Section III.C.5Section III.C.5 of the Draft Guidance also states that quantities of ingredients should be reported according to what is “contained in a tobacco product [accounting] for all additions, losses (e.g. of water or volatile solvents), and chemical reactions that may reasonably be expected to occur during manufacturing.”  Tobacco product manufacturers cannot currently measure the quantity of substances in their end products, as there are no testing methods that would allow consistent reporting across all products as FDA is seeking.  Both the European Union and Canada initially sought to receive reports of end product quantities such as that found in the Draft Guidance, but have since acknowledged that such reporting is not feasible.  These countries have therefore configured their electronic reporting platforms to report quantities according to the manufacturing specifications for tobacco products.  Moreover, unlike the European and Canadian laws, FDCA § 904(a)(1) calls for reporting ingredients “added by the manufacturer.”  JTI therefore requests that FDA revise the final guidance to clarify that quantities should be reported according to manufacturing specifications.E.Supplementary Information (Section III.C)When reporting ingredient information in other jurisdictions, JTI often provides supplementary information through cover letters and footnotes.  JTI requests that the final electronic reporting platform provide a means for inserting explanatory footnotes and other supplementary documents.F.Security and Protection of Trade Secrets (Section III.F)The Draft Guidance states that reports submitted pursuant to FDCA § 904(a)(1) may include, but will not be limited to, trade secret or confidential commercial information, and that such confidential information is protected from disclosure pursuant to FDCA § 906(c) and other statutes.  Though very limited portions of § 904(a)(1) ingredient reports, such as the manufacturer’s name and the brand name, may not be confidential information, the essence of these reports is to disclose to FDA the formula for individual tobacco products, which constitutes a trade secret of the most sensitive and economically valuable nature.  Therefore, JTI requests that FDA treat the entirety of these ingredient listings as trade secrets protected from disclosure.  Further, JTI considers the identity of its suppliers to be confidential commercial information and requests that FDA clarify that the identity of manufacturers reported pursuant to Section III.C.3(b) will be kept confidential.Due to the extremely sensitive nature of the information being provided to FDA, JTI would like confirmation that data can be permanently protected from unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure using Information Rights Management (IRM) in compliance with the ISO 17799 Standard (“Security of Information”).  If FDA cannot accept electronic documents secured by IRM, JTI requests that FDA provide specific information regarding how the information submitted will be secured.G.Reporting of Changes (Section III.D and Section III.E) The Draft Guidance indicates that submissions required by FDCA § 904(c), reporting changes in additives to tobacco products, may be provided to FDA through the same eSubmitter tool.  JTI strongly suggests that a distinction should be made between product maintenance—i.e., minor changes or adjustments to reflect standard manufacturing processes—from those of actual product changes.  For example, a change in tobacco weight which is within the range of manufacturing specifications should not result in the issuing of a new product report.  JTI requests that the FDA, in its final guidance, clarify that new reports under § 904(c) are required only when previously-reported manufacturing specifications change.H.Extension of Deadline (Section III.E)FDA is requesting a great deal of detail regarding each ingredient added to each of its brands, some of which are not required under ingredient reporting regulations in other jurisdictions.  Moreover, FDA is requesting that JTI provide this information through an unfamiliar electronic platform.  It will take a significant amount of time for JTI to obtain some of the requested information (if such information can be obtained at all), become familiar with the final requirements of the eSubmitter program, and perform testing to ensure the accuracy and security of its submissions.  JTI notes that FDA recently extended the deadline for FDCA § 905 product listing requirements, giving manufacturers approximately 120 days to comply after final guidance interpreting this section was issued.  Given the great complexity of reporting ingredients in the format specified by FDA, JTI requests that FDA likewise not enforce § 904(a)(1) until at least April 30th, 2010, and in no case sooner than 120 days after final guidance is issued.Sincerely,Thomas HirshfieldDirector, Corporate Affairs & CommunicationsJTI USA"

1687,FDA-2012-D-0071-1155,"I am shocked to learn that the FDA continues to support animal experimentation on tobacco products. Considered archaic and fundamentally flawed, product testing on animals lacks social legitimacy and validation.Furthermore, to foster an idea that consumers continually support animal experimentation due to some inaccurate notion that it will prevent them from being harmed is unprincipled. Animals suffer drastically different effects from tobacco use than humans.  Tobacco use and abuse can factually lead to harm regardless of how many animals are wrongfully killed during the product testing phase.Please make both the ethical and financially-responsible decision to discontinue animal experimentation immediately: remove any language recommending or allowing animal tests from its draft guidance on tobacco product testing;  join an increasing body of countries who are listening to a concerned and attentive consumer population who refuse to be complicit in the inherently malicious and ineffective industry of animal experimentation."

An eye-dropper bottle containing 36 mg of nicotine is enough to kill 4 toddlers.Unfortunately, nicotine for e-cigarettes comes in a variety of bright colors and flavors attractive to young children (as well as elementary school-aged future smokers), and is marked with packaging which also uses bright colors depicting candy, fruit and other items popular among children.Despite the fact that child-reststant packaging is among the most effective and time-tested methods for protecting children from poisioning hazards, there is currently no federal requirement that liquid nicotine containers have child-resistant packaging. Furthermore, a recent study of individuals who use e-cigarettes and reside in households with children found that 36% of those surveyed did not lock liquid nicotine in child resistant containers, and 13% stored liquid nicotine on open counters.The FDA has clear juristiction under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act to regulate tobacco products to prevent child poisioning. I urge you not only to require child-resistant packaging, but also to require flow restrictors, and nicotine exposure warnings specifically highlighting the risk of harm to children and including graphics on warning labels.

Director, Center for Tobacco ProductsFood and Drug Administration9200 Corporate BoulevardRockville, MD 20850Re: Docket No. FDA-2013-N-0521 Rulemaking for Menthol in Cigarettes and Tobacco Products Dear Director Zeller; Respiratory Health Association (RHA) is pleased to have the opportunity to comment on the FDA proposed rulemaking regarding menthol in cigarettes and tobacco products. Removing menthol from tobacco products would greatly reduce the toll of tobacco and improve health outcomes for our communities.   A cornerstone of the work of Respiratory Health Association has been to reduce the toll of tobacco on our community. RHA was one of the leaders in the successful efforts to adopt smoke-free laws at the local and state level and to increase taxes of tobacco products to reduce the impact of tobacco upon our community.  We are proud to collaborate on policy strategies to decrease tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke, with concentrated efforts aimed at high-burden population groups.  Evidence has shown that tobacco companies have been preying upon vulnerable populations and getting them addicted to their deadly products. Menthol leads to increased use of tobacco and is a starter product for youth tobacco addiction especially among LGBT, Hispanic and black youth. Almost all smokers in the U.S. begin smoking as adolescents. Research shows that newer smokers favor menthol cigarettes. Menthol can mask the harshness of cigarette smoke, providing a cooling sensation that has been found to appeal particularly to new, young smokers. While overall smoking rates in the U.S. are declining, use of menthol cigarettes, particularly among young smokers, is rising. Menthol cigarettes serve as a starter product for many youths and can provide a gateway to regular tobacco use.   •Use of menthol cigarettes is on the rise. While the overall smoking rate has decreased in the last decade, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health showed that between 2004 and 2008, the rate of menthol cigarette use steadily increased, especially among young smokers. •Menthol cigarettes are a gateway to regular tobacco use. Considerable research indicates that newer smokers favor menthol cigarettes at substantially higher levels than established smokers. Research further shows that a significant number of smokers eventually transition from menthol products to regular tobacco.•Vulnerable youth populations are impacted in larger numbers. Menthol cigarettes have been found to have a disparate impact on youth in vulnerable populations, such as women, racial minorities, the LGBTQ community and people of low socioeconomic status. •Menthol cigarettes are just as dangerous as regular cigarettes. Menthol cigarettes are not safer to smoke than regular cigarettes. Numerous studies have explored health dangers unique to menthol cigarettes.We appreciate your consideration of our comments. The evidence of the toll of menthol tobacco products is clear. We urge the FDA to act quickly to end this cycle of addiction by requiring tobacco companies to remove menthol as a flavoring in tobacco products.   Sincerely, Joel J. AfrickPresident and CEO"

We need to put an end to the notion that the only choice for smokers is to quit or die; it is neither the pragmatic nor the humanist thing to do. It is unconstitutional to deny smokers the right to know that such products could (or already do) exist.  By denying this information to smokers, this has now become a human rights issue. We are 1.5 billion strong worldwide, yet we have not been allowed to have a voice (or choice) about what happens to our own bodies. We have a right to make choices for ourselves and clearly it is the modern temperance movement that has denied us this most fundamental right. It is time for that to change.

1737,FDA-2013-N-0521-0469,"In accordance with the FDA’s Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) report in 2011 and the FDA’s most recent scientific evaluation menthol in cigarettes published in 2013, as well as the Citizens Petition, we urge the FDA to take the following immediate steps:1)Add menthol to the list of chemicals and compounds identified by the FDA as harmful constituents in tobacco products. The scientific evidence in the TPSAC report on menthol indicated that menthol in cigarettes increases the risk for smoking initiation, transition to regular smoking, nicotine dependence, and quitting difficulty. It is important for the FDA to modify and broaden its definition of harmful and potentially harmful products to include these harms, since this specific continuum caused by menthol, leads to adverse health effects.2)Consistent with section 206 of the FSPTCA, require that any amount of menthol in natural or synthetic form, menthol analogs, and any constituent that “mimics” the sensory effects and attributes of menthol (e.g. smell, taste, flavor, cooling/tingling effects, anesthetic, analgesic, reduction in tobacco irritation), be disclosed and listed on the label of tobacco products. 3)Consistent with section 201, require that along with the 9 warning label messages, that labels also state that, “menthol cigarettes increase risk for starting cigarette smoking”;  “menthol cigarettes are addictive”;  “menthol cigarettes cause quitting difficulty”.  These messages or versions of these messages are based on the scientific evidence in the TPSAC and FDA menthol reports, and will likely help to reduce any “risk perceptions” that suggest that menthol is less harmful.4)Consistent with section 910, that any new tobacco or nicotine product introduced into the market be required to demonstrate that menthol or additives and constituents that “mimic” menthol’s sensory effects in that product do not cause any additional harm than the product introduced without menthol. “Harm” is defined under #1.  5)We urge that the FDA conduct more research on any additives or constituents that mimic the sensory effects of menthol. 6)Finally, the FDA should move toward establishing as a product standard, zero levels of any additive, constituent, artificial or natural flavor that mimic the sensory effects of menthol in any tobacco or nicotine products to ensure that the FDA’s action on menthol is not undermined. The prohibition should include the entire cigarette/tobacco product and any packaging related to the cigarette/tobacco product. The product standard established by FDA should be “zero” levels in order to protect the public’s health, including the health of youth, minorities, and other vulnerable populations who suffer disproportionately from tobacco-related diseases. In 2011, TPSAC stated that “menthol is not just a flavored additive and the menthol cigarettes should be removed from the public health market.” The  FSPTCA states that, “Immediately upon the establishment of the  TPSCA under section 917(a), the Secretary shall refer to the Committee for report and recommendation, under section 917(c)(4), the issue of the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health, including such use among children, African-Americans, Hispanics, and other racial and ethnic minorities. In its review, the TPSCA shall address the considerations listed in subsections (a)(3)(B)(i) and (b).”  Thus, the examination of “population net impact” related to menthol is inclusive menthol’s effects on children, African Americans, Hispanics, Native Hawaiians, Other Pacific Islanders, Asian Americans and all the ethnic groups that comprise this aggregate category, and American Indians and Alaska Natives people of our nation.  “Minorities’” as an aggregate group now comprise about 37% of the U.S.; by 2043, the U.S. is projected to become a majority-minority nation; and by 2060, the U.S. Census projects that 57% of the population will be “minorities” (1). The menthol cigarette burden is disproportionately greater among disaggregate and the collective  “minority” group as compared to Whites (2).  Thus, we urge that FDA’s thinking around the impact that regulatory policies have on populations consider policy effects on “minorities”, and in the absence of the policies, the increased potential burden that menthol can have on the growing population of “minorities”.

I look forward to your agency tackling this new responsibility with vigor.I am also writing to urge you to enforce the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in a way that lays the groundwork for full, constructive U.S. participation in the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC).

Electronic cigarettes are potentially a great source of revenue for my company. Many of my customers are seeking alternatives to traditional tobacco products in retail stores like mine. Regrettably, there are a few sketchy companies that threaten the success of my company. Who knows where these companies are even located? There are many issues I have with the way these companies claim to run their business. For one, they don’t even invest back into the local communities. Also, they don’t create jobs within the community like my business does. The negative affects they have on local communities are far greater than the positive. Come to think of it, I can’t think of any positive, so why would the federal government allow this? My community was built on small business like mine, and so were many other communities across the U.S. It’s absolutely unfair for the federal government to favor these rogue retailers as opposed to the local retailers. By the way, how unreliable is age verification over the internet? They are extremely unreliable if you ask me. How does this keep our kids away from these products? I trust our local retailers much more than an online retailer who is just trying to make a quick buck. I recommend the FDA consider my comments and completely ban the regulation of non face-to-face tobacco sales or at least make the regulations harder on internet retailers.

The FDA should consider a number of non-traditional factors in making their decision.The tobacco industry has wide-ranging impacts, affecting not only farms and manufacturers, but also wholesale and retail stores.  Beyond the farm gate, value is added to tobacco leaf by combining it with other inputs and using labor and capital to process, store, market, advertise and transport it.  Businesses include a mark-up to make a profit and to cover excise taxes collected from manufacturers and wholesalers.  Generally, the manufacturers pay federal excise taxes; the wholesalers pay state excise taxes and consumers pay sales taxes on a percentage of retail sales value.  Last fiscal year, menthol cigarettes accounted for over $900 million in pre-tax sales revenues in our state.  The loss in tax revenue from a ban on menthol cigarettes alone would have a vast impact on our state budget.  North Carolina received over $250 million in tax revenue from the sales tax imposed on cigarettes last fiscal year.  Menthol cigarettes attributed almost one-third of the cigarettes sales tax revenue.Clearly, there is incentive for the contraband market to add this product to their broad distribution network.  In doing so placing an added burden to law enforcement agencies as institutions and agents as individuals.  Furthermore, a significant contraband market will deny governments of revenue; increase availability of illicit cigarettes to underage youths, and fuel organized crime groups.  It is especially important to consider these factors when dealing with a banning a previously legal product.  In doing so, we are inviting the underground market to take over the demand. "

I personally have been tobacco free for over two years due soely to personal vaporizers. I agree that liquids containing nicotine should require child proof packaging, however I am not in favor of regulation of all personal vapor devices to the point of outlawing said devices. Doing so could potentially prevent millions of tobacco smokers  access to a life saving device.

1771,FDA-2013-N-0521-0196,"Dear U.S. Food and Drug Administration:    As a working representative of Lorillard Tobacco Company, I wanted to express my concern with any futureregulation or ban of menthol cigarettes. Scientific evidence has proved that menthol smokers are at no more of ahealth risk than non-menthol smokers. I believe that adult smokers should continue to have a choice to smoke and to be able to choose menthol or non-menthol. Approximately 500,000 U.S. jobs including mine depend on the sale of menthol as well. A ban of menthol would result in so many negative outcomes. Counterfeit sales would increase causing more health risks to the consumer along with more criminal activity. The government also depends on a large amount of revenue from the sale of menthol cigarettes which make up approximately 30% of the cigarette market."

It is unreasonable to expect that any information they provide the committee would be truthful in the spirit of full disclosure.

First and foremost, these animals did not choose to smoke, unlike many humans who do. There must be other ways regulators can test tobacco. In this day, if people cannot understand the risks of smoking, then what must be done is more education regarding the toxins and chemicals. I hope tobacco industries do not make donations because it would only mean that the ill effects of the product will continue to be hidden.

1792,FDA-2012-D-0071-1784,"Speaking for the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), a consumer-education and advocacy nonprofit devoted to sound science-based public health policy, we implore the FDA to be flexible in your approach to dealing with MRTPs, including smokeless products, dissolvables, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).We are aware that the FDA has stated that it intends to propose a regulation to apply Chapter IX to all currently unregulated tobacco products, Section 911 does not as of now apply to e-cigarettes nor to dissolvable tobacco products.  When deciding what level of evidence would permit notification of consumers, especially smokers, about the relative risks/reduced risks of a smokeless tobacco product, as compared to cigarettes, ACSH urges the FDA to be ever-cognizant of the plight of the 46,000,000 addicted smokers in America. They deserve to be able to be truthfully informed that the health risks of the non-combustible products noted above are almost equal to no tobacco use at all. Moreover, based on solid epidemiological evidence involving smokeless/snus-type products, they have been shown to, or are highly likely to, markedly increase the likelihood of smoking cessation among those addicted to nicotine.A growing body of scientific evidence has found that switching to a smokefree tobacco product/nicotine delivery system reduces a smoker’s mortality risks nearly as much as quitting all tobacco/nicotine.  Nonsmokers are also exposed to less tobacco smoke when smokers switch to smokeless tobacco, meaning second-hand smoke is eliminated completely.  In fact, NRT and smokeless tobacco products have very similar health risk and benefit profiles.Since >99% of all tobacco attributable deaths and healthcare costs in the US are caused by the repeated inhalation of tobacco smoke, and that <1% are caused by smokeless tobacco products, it is vitally important for the FDA to publicly acknowledge the exponential differences of risk between cigarettes and smokele"
1793,FDA-2009-N-0294-0056,"I just wanted to say that we need to stop the constant raising of the taxes on cigarettes.  It is getting out of hand.  I am just a low paid blue collar worker myself.  Smoking helps me keep my stress levels down.  Smoking is my only vis and do not plan on giving it up, and that is my right.  This country is becoming less and less of a free country.  The goverment wants to force us to quit smoking by raising the taxes so hi that we will have to choose between food and a pack of smokes.  All these none smokers think it is so easy to quit.  I have tryed 6 times to quit and had no luck, so I am just going to keep smoking.  It is my right to do with my body what I want, so I thought.  We are losing our freedoms slowly.  They want to band firearms and take away our right to protect our families, and want to force us in to quiting smoking.  Why can't the goverment just let us be.  Instead of banning cigarettes in places, they should allow us to have ccertain place where we can go out to eat and have a cigarette, or a bar where we can smoke.  They could have signs on the doors that says this is a smoking establishment.  Then none smoker would no not to go in there if they didn't like the smell of smoke.  Why are we the ones being punished?  As far as weed goes, it is less harmful then drinking.  I have never seen a husband beat up his wife after smoking a joint, but I have seen that after a man has been drinking.  So why is drinking legal when it causes so many bad things to happen, and weed isn't.  Weed just makes people hungry and tierd.  We should put some of these drug dealers out of bussiness buy making weed legal.  Sell it like a pack of cigarettes and this way the goverment makes money off the taxes.  Don't get me wrong, I do not smoke weed, but I don't see the harm in it.  I have seen many of people when they are on it, and they are calm and mellow.  They aren't starting bar fights, hitting people with their cars, beating up their loved ones, cause they are calm and just want to sit there and relax."

1796,FDA-2012-D-0071-1273,"Hello, My name is Lilia Chunir and I am 15 years of age. I'm submitting this comment to kindly give my opinion on the new Tobacco testing on laboratory rats. It is my earnest belief that animals shouldn't be treated carelessly merely because they weren't given a voice, and seem vulnerable. Animals are treated with no regard to their welfare, which makes me think 'how would humans feel if they were the subject of experimentation, or dissected, or beaten relentlessly?' 'How long would they last being treated cruelly and inhumanely, with no voice to be heard?' Frankly, they wouldn't last much long. These poor, helpless animals endure such repulsive acts every single day. Humans would't be able to endure the pain and hardships these innocent creatures bear in these laboratories as defenseless subjects. Animals are defenseless and haven't done any act to deserve such pains. I am one of many who have a heart and are willing to become the voice of those who weren't born with one. Thus, here I stand, a young adult with fifteen years of age, who has had enough of the injustice that occurs in this world, and urges the FDA to remove this testing of Tobacco Products on rats. Hopefully, these words, along with the millions you may have received, help the FDA realize that we are all equal in this world, this includes animals, and we shouldn't treat them in this manner; we don't have the right to.

Therefore, we recommend that TPSAC postpone its September 13-14 meeting on the Camel Snus MRTP applications until at least 60 days after the complete and entire MRTP applications are made publicly available, thereby giving the public more time to carefully review and submit written comments to TPSAC.

Ifmenthol cigarettes were ban, I'm sure that would eliminate a huge portion of thejobs Lorillard creates nationwide and probably my job. At 55 years of age wherecould I start a new career in the the last 3rd of my working career, and have asimilar income. I don't believe the opportunity is out there. I would also liketo mention that I have 8 Grandchildren that I would like to assist financiallythrough life in some fashion.Cigarette manufacturing and sales provides thousands of jobs to people acrossthe country. A ban on menthol cigarettes threatens to trade a substantialportion of those jobs for illegal and overseas jobs. People will not stopsmoking menthol cigarettes but instead will buy counterfeit cigarettes madeoverseas. Hard working Americans will lose their jobs all while illegal marketsthrive.In short, these new rules won’t do much to build up goodwill for healthinitiatives throughout the US. If the FDA was serious about making the UnitedStates a healthier place to live and work, putting new restrictions on a productthat is already legal and hasn’t been proven to be unhealthier than othercomparable alternatives isn’t the way to do it. I’m disheartened by this proposal.If the FDA decides to increase regulations on menthol cigarettes there is goingto be an increase in the demand for black market menthol cigarettes. This meansmore criminal activity and more empowered organized crime. These groups make alot of money off of contraband smuggling and making it harder for people topurchase menthol cigarettes is only going to put more money in their pockets.The FDA needs to be very careful as they consider how to proceed in relation tomenthol cigarettes.Please keep menthol cigarettes legal and available to consumers.Sincerely,Efren BenavidezREF: FDA-2013-N-0521"

But decades of human epidemiology studies prove this link and other devastating effects tobacco has on human health.The Institute of Medicine says that it is not possible to make laboratory animals use tobacco products the way humans do, and there are inherent interspecies differences that prevent meaningful extrapolation of effects to humans.The self-addiction studies that FDA recommends be performed in animals, such as “place preference,” “drug discrimination,” and “self-administration” studies, are not only cruel, but tenuously linked to human behavior.Tobacco is inherently hazardous and poses serious risks to the user’s health and to the health of others. Testing more cigarettes, additives, and other tobacco products on animals will not protect public health."

I have used e-liquids for over two years and every bottle I have purchased has been in child-resistant packaging, every bottle has indicated the nicotine level in the liquid and more recently have also included warning labels concerning the dangers of nicotine.

There is a false sense of invinciblility, and little knowledge of the harm that smoking/tobacco use produces.Another population I serve is the mental health population. There are studies that show people who smoke have some form of Depression or mental health challenge. Please consider more affordable nicotine replacement costs for this population.I would encourage the FDA to consider creating the Nicotine Replacement Therapies specififically for youth. The youngest smoker I spoke with about quitting smoking was 11 years old. How can the the FDA help these kids?

No possible benefits of the proposed rulemaking could possibly offset the damage to consumers and public health from the deeming regulation.I ask you to please consider the fact nicotine in the low concentrations found in eliquids is not very toxic, there are so many other many products we use in every day life that pose a much greater accidental exposure hazard than the eliquid products in question.

I look forward to your agency tackling this new responsibility with vigor.I am also writing to urge you to enforce the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in a way that lays the groundwork for full, constructive U.S. participation in the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). As you know, the U.S. is one of the few remaining countries that have not ratified this treaty, so our citizens are not yet protected by its life-saving measures.You will need to be vigilant, as there is one glaring inconsistency between this new law and the global tobacco treaty. Because Big Tobacco has a fundamental and irreconcilable conflict of interest with public health, the treaty safeguards health policy against tobacco industry interference.Unfortunately, this new legislation gives the tobacco industry a seat at the table in setting FDA policies. Including industry representatives on the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee is akin to letting the fox guard the henhouse. The tobacco corporations will seek to exploit this loophole, just as they are trying to get governments around the world to ignore their obligations under the FCTC.I urge you to resist and bring to light any attempts by the tobacco industry to undermine FDA regulation. Along with other members of Corporate Accountability International, I will be closely following the exercise of your new authority, and thank you in advance for your work to protect our kids from Big Tobacco's dirty tricks and predatory marketing.Sincerely, Dr. Jeanne C.

But decades of human epidemiology studies prove this link and other devastating effects tobacco has on human health.The Institute of Medicine says that it is not possible to make laboratory animals use tobacco products the way humans do, and there are inherent interspecies differences that prevent meaningful extrapolation of effects to humans. The self-addiction studies that FDA recommends be performed in animals, such as “place preference,” “drug discrimination,” and “self-administration” studies, are not only cruel, but tenuously linked to human behavior. Tobacco is inherently hazardous and poses serious risks to the user’s health and to the health of others.

1918,FDA-2009-N-0294-0038,"This comment is regarding:Federal, State, and local government collaboration;Smoking cessation;Enforcement; andSale and distribution of tobacco products.Certain states have liquor control boards which regulate the sale of liquor via state-run stores/facilities.  Similarly, the FDA could establish a licensing or certification for the sales of tobacco, which could then be enforced via spot inspections.  There are a few precedents for establishing federal control of tobacco.  The above mentioned state-control of liquor could be a guideline, as well as the various european countries (such as Italy and Spain among others) which have or have had state monopolies on tobacco.  These monopolies included federally fixed prices on tobacco, and controlled sales points.Since there is already a network of specialist tobacconist outlets throughout the US, implementation of said licensing and control could be accomplished with minimal effort.  Licencing fees could be paid by tobacconists, partially offsetting implementation costs, which would come in addition to fees which the federal government already collects from tobacco revenues and the industry (which will continue to increase).  Licensing could also mandate that said retail outlets must also provide FDA information on smoking cessation, as well as the listings of the results of chemical analyses of the tobacco products.    As retail specialist tobacconist outlets do not exist in every small town in America as there once may have been, demand for new outlets might require the establishment of new outlets, which would require FDA licensing to operate.Most states have had laws restricting tobacco sales to minors in one form or another since at least the 1950's.  Existing laws have not been enforcable as there was simply no real infrastructure to do so.  By licensing tobacco vending points and restricting tobacco sales only to specialist, licesnced tobacconists, the infrastructure is created by which current laws can be enforced, and smoking cessation efforts can be concentrated.  This will remove tobacco products from vending points which minors typically frequent, such as Grocery/Supermarkets, Drug Stores and Gas Stations.  Thank you!"

I have three small children and I'm very concerned about the growing availability of liquid nicotine in the homes that my children go to visit. Although I can baby proof things in my own home,  when my children go to other peoples' homes they may very well come across a small bottle which smells and tastes delicious. But in fact just a small sip of its contents could kill them. More concerning,  is if they even spell it on their skin, it can still be absorbed and is still toxic and possibly deadly. A small bottle of liquid nicotine which may smell as enticing as a pia colada or a candycane can kill 4 toddlers.   Whether you are a person who uses liquid nicotine or not, no one wants children to get hurt or die because of it. I think we can say that in this country it is our job as adults to protect children.Many household products, some of which are are far less toxic than liquid nicotine, are required to be sold in child resistant packaging.

1930,FDA-2013-N-0521-0037,"Dear U.S. Food and Drug Administration:On July 23, 2013, the Food and Drug Administration sought public comment and information related to menthol in cigarettes.  I am submitting these comments on behalf of our company and its [30] employees regarding the question of whether the FDA should regulate menthol in cigarettes.As tobacco wholesalers, it is clear to us that unreasonable regulation, including a ban on menthol in cigarettes, would have significant unintended results. Illicit tobacco markets are pervasive today.  Illicit markets will only become worse if the FDA imposes overly restrictive regulations on menthol in cigarettes or bans them.The contraband market would thrive under unreasonable regulation of menthol cigarettesand would increase criminal activity, including activities by organized crime and terrorist groups.  Federal and state law enforcement efforts already are under tremendous pressure.  They will not be able to handle the resulting increase in criminal activities.Wholesalers are licensed by the states where we operate and are subject to many laws and regulations.  If menthol cigarettes are treated differently than non-menthol cigarettes, legal sales will be driven underground and outside of government supervision.   In addition, some entrepreneurs will likely smuggle cigarettes from low-tax jurisdictions, self-mentholate them, and resell them – thereby further increasing criminal activities and adding even more enforcement burdens to law enforcement.In addition, restrictive regulation of menthol cigarettes would have severe adverse effects on those employed in our industry.  Many thousands of working Americans – including those in our industry – rely on menthol sales for their jobs beyond the factory workers who manufacture them.  Overall, nearly 500,000 U.S. jobs depend in whole or in part on the sale of menthol through existing legal channels.We speak from experience.  Wholesalers already face underground market competition in many product areas.  Adding menthol cigarettes to this inventory of items will drive even more sales underground – putting more companies out of business and more people out of work.  So, the consequences would be lost jobs and lost tax revenues to federal, state and local governments, many of whom are already cutting services because of revenue shortfalls.Unreasonable regulation of menthol cigarettes is a bad idea.  Banning menthol will trade good paying, legal jobs and taxes for illegal jobs and a thriving contraband market that will have negative effects on public health.Sincerely,Eugene NaydovichJN Distributor"

I realize that some people may just look at these rats as rodents or something now to be cared about but this is not the way to treat ANY animal and I strongly hope this DISTURBING testing will not be allowed to happen!

1958,FDA-2012-D-0071-0914,"Was not sure if this was the appropriate department to send this to however I'm sure that regardless the message will get through to the proper authorities. I have been keeping an eye on the progress( or lack there of) that the government has been taking in regards to animal testing. Not only for things such as chemicals, cosmetics, and medical purposes but also on such harmful things such as tobacco. I am approaching this not only from the perspective of a human being who loves and cherishes the lives of animals but as a person who feels that the health of humans is also important. I know what kind of damage tobacco can do to the human body. I lost my mother at the age of fourteen due to lung and brain cancer caused by her years of smoking. I have witnessed the damages it has caused others in similar manners with various forms of cancer as well as the damage it does to helpless nonsmokers who are forces to inhale the noxious fumes. Seeing as the Surgeon General's Warning that is listed on the backs of tobacco products clearly states that smoking can/may cause these kinds of defects, as well as the fact that smoking is very much spoken against by schools as well as public health officials it can be safely stated that people are well aware of what kinds of harm it can cause to humans and animals alike. To continue to test these horrendous products on innocent animals is ridiculous. There is no need to force defenseless animals to inhale these products. To kill them and dissect them to observe the harm that these tests have inflicted on their bodies. To breed an animal simply to harm, kill, and study it is human cruelty at its finest. We would not do these things to innocent children, why to animals? Knowing what we do know about smoking it is nothing more than a basic example of insanity. Repeating the same action over and over expecting different results. Please, I implore you to stop this madness. Stop testing these products on innocent animals.  Thank you."

The taste of the cigarettes makes some people sick and ruins the flavor in general.Why does the government feel the need to control cigarette smoking? There are enough warning available for the consumer to read about the hazards. To control how the cigarettes are made is going to far in my estimation.

Instead of responsible cigarette sales, cigarettes would be readily and easily available to minors. I have read the argument that, since menthol would be banned, there would be none to put on the black market. I don't agree.

2050,FDA-2013-N-0521-0265,"On behalf of the North Carolina State AFL-CIO, I am writing to express concern with the potential ban on menthol cigarettes.Tobacco is still a staple economic benefactor to many North Carolinians on the farm and in the factory.  There are thousands of workers dependent upon tobacco from the mountains to the Coastal Plains.  While many citizens will debate the health related impacts of tobacco, it is a vital commercial product for our state.  Tobacco is heavily regulated in a manner allowing individuals to make an informed and conscious choice in deciding whether to consume the product.   Still today in a highly regulated environment, tobacco is important to keeping many North Carolinians employed and working.In addition to the impact on working families throughout our state, a ban on menthol cigarettes would impact law enforcement and state tax revenues.   A menthol ban would create a black market for the product, divert finite resources (time, money and personnel) from core law enforcement activities, create a loss of significant tax revenue to support general government needs collected on legitimate regulated sales, and hurt small businesses. Additionally, a ban on menthol cigarettes could lead to job loss having a detrimental economic impact on a state built upon a strong tobacco heritage.  Therefore, we respectfully request you carefully review this policy and adequately study the consequential impacts a ban would have on our industry and the economy. Thank you for your consideration in this matter."

2066,FDA-2009-N-0294-0443,"I would like to share my suggestions regarding the Regulation of Tobacco Products, specifically in the areas of New Product Submission and Approval, Tobacco Flavoring and Tobacco Marketing and Labeling.Tobacco companies have been trying to make less harmful cigarettes or ways of delivering nicotine since the 1970s.  Examples include the Eclipse and the Accord cigarettes.  All of the different nicotine delivery options have been created due to the public’s concern with the harm caused by smoking, not because the tobacco industry was being regulated.  Going forward, the FDA should only approve new tobacco products that assist in smoking cessation.  The approval of these products will have to be modified from the standard FDA processes, as tobacco use is not being condoned.  The new products shall follow all of the regulations listed in the bill and must be marketed as FDA approved smoking cessation aids.  Current smoking alternatives such as Revel and Ariva use words like “anytime,” “anywhere” and “…when you can’t smoke…” as part of their marketing.  New and current products such as these should not be marketed as an adjunct to smoking.  It should be clearly stated that these products are being sold as NRTs (nicotine replacement therapy) in an effort to assist in smoking cessation and to reduce the risk of lung cancer caused by smoking.On September 22, 2009 the ban of flavored tobacco products went into affect.  This ban should be altered to include all tobacco products, even those not meant for cigarette smoking.  This ban should not exclude menthol because menthol is a strong flavor and 75% of all African American smokers smoke menthol flavored cigarettes.  The American Legacy Foundation reports that approximately 44% of smokers age 12-17 use menthol cigarettes.  By adding menthol to the ban, the large population of African American smokers and the growing number of youth that are smoking menthol cigarette will likely be deterred from smoking as well.Controlling the labels on cigarette cartons is an important step forward but should be take to the next level.  It should be mandatory for cigarette cartons to have graphic photographs of the damage that smoking can cause to a persons mouth and lungs.  Cigarette cartons should also contain statistics on the detrimental effects of smoking and information on where to go for cessation support and assistance.  Smoking causes serious harm and this fact should be made very clear on each box of cigarettes.Best,Nancy Pope"

Many of these people have tried other cessation methods in past. But, e-cigarettes were the answer for them. However, such tobacco products should be purchased at their local retailer in a face-to-face transaction because age verification on the Internet is too easily manipulated by children.Let’s keep tobacco products out of the hands of children!Thank you."
2082,TTB-2009-0002-0024,"The proposed rule intends to ensure that pipe tobacco is accurately and clearly labeled and categorized as such and that roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco is accurately and clearly labeled and categorized as such, given that the two tobacco products are subject to different tax rates, with RYO tobacco being taxed at a rate that parallels the federal cigarette tax rate, and pipe tobacco being taxed at a sharply lower rate. Traditionally, pipe tobacco uses different tobacco than is used for roll your own products. The two forms of tobacco are not interchangeable, and, therefore, the labeling of roll your own tobacco as pipe tobacco is a fraud solely designed to get around the tax laws and the new FDA law. Unfortunately, the proposed regulations do not do enough either to require clear and accurate labeling or to prohibit the mislabeling of RYO tobacco as “pipe tobacco” to evade applicable taxes. The proposed rule does not forbid tobacco in packages clearly marked with the words “pipe tobacco” from being qualified for the lower pipe tobacco tax rate even if the packaging also includes phrases such as “also suitable for roll-your-own cigarettes” or “may also be used to make RYO cigarettes or cigars.” At the very minimum, the final rule should clearly state that any tobacco marked as pipe tobacco still will not qualify for taxation as pipe tobacco if its packaging, including inserts or onserts, or its advertising or marketing includes any words or messages of any kind that indicate that the tobacco can also be used as tobacco for RYO cigarettes or cigars. Even with that change, however, RYO tobacco could still be sold and taxed as pipe tobacco if its packaging and advertising referred to it as only pipe tobacco. Therefore, TTB should establish clear criteria to distinguish between those types of tobacco that may be labeled as pipe tobacco and those that may not.[Full comments attached.]"

2093,FDA-2012-N-0143-0036,"Dear FDA & President Trump,I began smoking combustible cigarettes at age 17 and smoked at least a pack of day of cigarettes for 18 years. After years of smoking, I was so sick from smoking but I was highly addicted to the nicotine in combination with the oral fixation. I was regularly being treated for sinus infections, acute and chronic bronchitis, respiratory infections, pre-asthma, pre-emphysema, etc. It was getting worse. I started needing an inhaler for my breathing problems and taking steroids as it kept getting more difficult to clear my lungs during the infections. I was a wheezing, coughing, sickly mess!!  It didn't matter that I was sick, I kept smoking anyway. I couldn't quit. I COULD NOT QUIT SMOKING. I tried Chantix, hypnosis, nicotine gum, nicotine lozenge, nicotine patch and NONE of that worked for me. Chantix is a medication that makes you forget that you need cigarettes, but it also makes you not care about anything going on in your life, you don't care if you go to work or if your kids get on the school bus. Had to stop that right away due to the serious SIDE effects of the Chantix.  That stuff is not good for people's mental health. In September or October of 2012, I discovered BLU e-cigarettes at a convenience store. Out of desperation, I bought the device and some cartridges. I first tried the tobacco flavored cartridges, but they were so nasty tasting that this wasn't the answer. I then tried some of the other flavors offered by BLU e-cigs and found that I liked the cherry flavor, and the peach flavor, but I finally settled on the pina colada flavor as the flavor that I credit with my COMPLETE ABILITY TO QUIT combustible (very harmful/KILLER) tobacco cigarettes. It took me about 3 full months to wean off of combustible cigarettes by vaping, and I am SO HAPPY to report that I was able to shift to a product that I feel has saved my life. I have been only using a vape since the end of December 2012, and I am SMOKE FREE for nearly 7 years now. I vape every day, and I vape as often as when I smoked because I need the nicotine. Yes, I am an addict, and only an addict can truly understand this addiction. It is at least as addictive as heroin. I will never escape from my nicotine addiction, but I can focus on less harmful means that are EFFECTIVE in smoking cessation, and that means VAPING for life. However, I can't continue my harm reduction if the government bans the flavors that made this possible for me. Adult smokers deserve to have choices that don't serve as reminders of combustible cigarettes, I don't want to vape anything that tastes like tobacco or menthol. I don't need reminders of that addiction to fuel my return to harmful tobacco/combustible cigarettes. I am 43 years old now, and I am smoke free. This is an absolute miracle. My health has never been better since quitting smoking and turning to vaping. I have medical proof of that. What the FDA should do is show some concern for the millions of us smokers who are battling to save our lives here and allow us our flavors. We are grown adults and can make our own choices. Where you should impose restrictions are at the point of sale and verify the age of the purchaser. THIS is what will stop teens from getting access to e-cigs and preventing addiction. If someone would have carded me for buying tobacco cigarettes when I was 17, I would not have suffered a lifetime of nicotine addiction. CARD THE TEENS, AND VERIFY AGE. Banning flavors won't solve the problem, and banning flavors harms millions of former smokers just like me who deserve to live longer lives through the use of vaping as the only thing that has successfully helped us break up with tobacco cigarettes. Additionally, if you want to know if e-cigarettes are harmful, you need to study those who have been long term users, just like me. We have medical records that can show the improvement in our health. After only 18 months of just using a vape, I was treated for something different in the ER and was informed that I had the lungs of a non-smoker. There are volumes of proof available to see what I am telling you is true. I am a statistic, and there are many more just like me out there. Talk to us, and you'll see it's true. VAPING IS HARM REDUCTION AND IS REAL SMOKING CESSATION. I do also want to reiterate that kids should never try vaping nor should they have access to these products. These products are meant for adult smokers who want to quit smoking by using vaping as smoking cessation. There are already laws that prevent youth access, so why are these not being enforced? Enforce them, and you will stop youth vaping. Ban flavors and you will create a massive, unregulated black market for vaping products of questionable ingredients and jeopardize the health and safety of millions of vape users who only use flavors other than tobacco or menthol. Please allow me to live my life healthy & smoke free with my vape and my flavors of choice.#MakeMyVapeGreatAgain"

2113,FDA-2011-N-0467-0007,"A. Non-Face-to-Face Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products3. Internet sales are most likely the method used most by minors to acquire tobacco products in a non-face-to-face way.  This is probably because of the ease of ordering, maybe less strict methods of identifying age, and familiarity with the internet with today's youth. Usually on websites with age restrictions, it just asks for a date of birth, which would not be hard to add a few years to reach the acceptable age.5.d. A higher standard would be to require the shipment to only be delivered to the person ordering the package, as well as requiring that person to be an adult meeting the age requirements of the shipment.  Both of these requirements will help limit the availability of non-face-to-face shipment of tobacco products to minors. 9. On some sites, access to the site is restricted to members only.  The membership requires an age verification that is generally 21 and not 18. B. AdvertisingMost advertising that I see about tobacco products is in magazines, but never particularly geared toward non-face-to-face exchanges. They are usually just a general advertisement.When I am on the internet, visiting various sites, I rarely ever come across an advertisement for tobacco products.  14. On Facebook though, social website, businesses can create profiles. So a tobacco store could have a profile, showing new shipments that have arrived and posting pictures of people smoking that might influence minors, and also comments. I don't think there is a way though that minors would be able to purchase through the site though, it is more geared towards just advertisement.To restrict minors access to these profiles, the website should enable an age restriction to view the page as well as to like or become a fan of the page. This would not be too difficult because generally Facebook members put their date of birth in their profile as part of setting up an account. "

I have had no side effects from ejuice getting on my skin or occasionally getting it in my mouth. The strength of nic I use is an average strength that most people prefer. To put these products in a class with tobacco would be a crime. It would shut down most of the business that has accumulated in the last 7 years. This action could push people right back to traditional tobacco and that is what the FDA is suppose to prevent. The low levels of nicotine is far from toxic that is found in ejuice. Vaping has changed my life for not only a better state of health, but has given me a wonderful hobby that my wife and I enjoy very much. I have friends that went from unemployment to successfull business owners. The last study I saw that the FDA is using for ammunition against vaping is just insane.

The big decision will be with mentholated cigarettes  - we will be helpful in provisding detailed information - are initial work in tobacco control was with mentholated cigarettes.Next the Tobacco Center should look at flavored cigars and snuff.  Altra-USST's  Skoal snuff most have 10 or more flavors and  Altria's  Black&Mild cigars, very popular with kids, with flavors like apple, cherry and wine. Must stop the selling of these cigars  one at a time. Decisions most be broader  so you don't have the problem banning flavored cigarettes so the same product then turns up as a cigarillo.Harm reduction - you'll be bombarded with products from tobacco companies that they'll claim are less harmful. They will indicate these products are  for those hard-line smokers that refuse to try to quit.  But it's impossible to limit distribution to only these individuals. Tobacco companies have other plans they want to  sell as much product as possible these means promotions to hook young adults and kids that want to be like young adults. This has to be stopped.

2185,FDA-2009-N-0294-0328,"Dear Sir,Having read much of the literature related to the FDA control of the Tobacco industry I would like to make the following comments: - The timeline being proposed for making changes looks very ambitious to me.As the President of Payne Richmond Inc, a tear tape supplier to the Tobacco industry in North America, I have experienced regulatory change, in particular in Canada and have seen at first hand the turmoil caused by what were overly ambitious impletmentation plans. I would ask you to consider extending all the deadlines set so far to allow the industry as a whole to invest and implement in a controlled manner. As an example, one of the early activities you have sighted, is the banning of descriptors next year. I have been with a number of cigarette companies in recent weeks and can see clearly that the implementation of this alone is causing issues for the industry. - I would ask that any moves you make to challenge the harmful effects of cigarettes are based on clear scientific fact. Furthermore, I feel the consumers would expect that such evidence is clearly presented to the market as a whole in a manner which is easily understood. - I would also ask that the costs of funding the FDA activity is carefully managed. I have heard such numbers as $10bn being funded by the industry over a ten year period to support the FDA operation. My fear here is that the money will be funded through increased pricing for cigarettes which in turn will force the consumer to seek cheaper alternatives. In the worst case scenario, the cheaper alternative will be an open opportunitiy for the counterfeit market to grow. The result of this will be the demise of what is a professional, ethically managed industry, loss of tax revenue for the Government and a diversion of funds to the counterfeiters who can then use those funds for activities which, we know, are not for the greater good of the nation.   I thank you for the opportunity to comment."

2199,FDA-2013-N-0521-0067,"Re:  Docket No. FDA-2013-N-0521To Whom It May Concern:On July 23, 2013, the Food and Drug Administration sought public comment and information related to menthol in cigarettes.  I am submitting these comments on behalf of the Vermont Grocers’ Association and our member retailers regarding the question of whether the FDA should regulate menthol in cigarettes.VGA represents over 600 stores in Vermont, from small country and convenience stores to supermarkets.As retailers, we believe strongly that overly restrictive regulations, including a ban on menthol in cigarettes, would have significant unintended results. Current contraband activity in tobacco is well documented, and counterfeit cigarettes are smuggled into the country today. With a ban, contraband menthol cigarettes would inevitably be sold through an expansion of the current underground market. Outlawing menthol in cigarettes would unquestionably have negative effects.Illicit markets would have a significantly negative effect on public health. Youth smoking is one area that demands particular attention.  Given a contraband market, it is counterintuitive to believe that a menthol ban will reduce underage smoking, the announced objective of Tobacco Control Act.   In fact, illicit tobacco markets undermine public health efforts to prevent underage smoking.Much of the responsibility to curb tobacco sales to underage youths falls on retailers.  Retailers are on the front lines of preventing sales to underage youths by supporting and implementing efforts to prevent underage smoking. Our member retailers perform the standard age check and they undergo periodic reviews to ensure compliance with age-of-purchase laws.  They take these responsibilities seriously.Illicit markets, however, undermine efforts to prevent underage smoking. If menthol is banned or severely restricted, retailers will be competing with a greatly expanded underground market for cigarettes.  Cigarette sales won’t occur in our stores.  Sales will take place down the street, outside our stores, and you can bet that these street-corner vendors won’t check IDs for birthdates.   If that occurs, it will hinder the progress we have made toward reducing access to cigarettes for minors. Studies back up this conclusion.  In 2007, 2008 and 2009, the Canadian Convenience Stores Association surveyed hundreds of sites to study the proliferation of contraband tobacco at high schools in Ontario and Quebec.  It found that nearly one-third of the cigarettes found at Ontario high schools and more than 40 percent of those found at Quebec high schools were contraband products.An ban would also be undercut because entrepreneurs will smuggle cigarettes from low-tax jurisdictions and self-mentholate them to add to their profits.  In addition, illicit markets result in a negative effect on public health because of the sales of more low-cost counterfeit cigarettes.  Many illicit cigarettes contain unknown contents or quality and are not made in compliance with FDA requirements.  State and federal studies, in fact, have shown that counterfeit cigarettes contain far more dangerous ingredients.  The ATF warned of this when it said in a fact sheet, “consumers do not know what ingredients are used to manufacture these cigarettes.  Counterfeit cigarettes pose a significant health risk to consumers for this reason.”Unreasonable regulation of menthol cigarettes is a bad idea.  Banning menthol will trade good paying, legal jobs and taxes for illegal jobs and a thriving contraband market that will have negative effects on public health.Sincerely,Jim HarrisonVermont Grocers’ Association"

2201,TTB-2010-0004-0124,"The nickle and diming tax increase agenda must stop. Do not vote for any more tax increases of any type. I can remember Barak Obama specifically stating that there would be NO TAX INCREASES on anyone not making more than $250,000. As it turns out, that was an outright lie. It has already been done. I know that you seem to justfy these increases in the fact that tobacco use is not a healthful activity, but to discourage its use through tax increases is just Federal bullying of the people. If you do not wish to use it, then don't; but Congress must stop attempting to legislate everything they don't agree with. I can guarantee that I will vote for noone that votes in favor of this atrocity."

The ABC system for liquor in North Carolina and elsewhere might be a model.  Make the licence fee high so as to reduce the numbers of retailers, thus facilitating regular inspection and testing.c) Require wholesale purchasers of tobacco products to hold the Federal licence for retailers.d) Consonant with b) and c), ban:i)  Internet sales of all tobacco products to persons without the Federal licence for retailers.ii) Cigarette dispensing machines (these still exist in some states)e) Ban smoking while driving in much the same way as (in many states) driving while using a hand-held cell phone.f)  Make unaviodable, passive inhalation of tobacco smoke into one type of assault under the criminal law.g) Require specific warning signs on all premises that permit tobacco smoking, in much the same way as for buildings that contain other carcinogenic or radioactive materials.

2229,FDA-2011-N-0467-0078,"As a provider of premium cigars to end consumers via mail order I can bring a pretty good perspective on the current discussion. It can broken into 3 areas of focus. Liberty and Choice are crucial elements that would be affected. We sell to a large portion to the military which do not have access to premium cigars where they are stationed in Afghanistan fighting for our Country. Not only the military but highly remote areas including Alaska, other remote rural areas all across the Country and even the South Pole where there is little to no access to cigars. We need to understand that our Country was founded on Liberty and free choice. We should not be passing legislation or rules to infringe on these basic Liberties and choices for our consumers. Economics is another key consideration. Before the Pact Act was passed that banned smokeless tobacco sales online we were shipping 100's of packages daily to Iraq and Afghanistan via USPS basically stripping them of this choice. It's easy to market a law or regulation as a guise to save a few kids from possibly getting smokeless tobacco, but what is lost are the greater ramifications. A simple fix would have been to require 18 year signature just like the alcohol deliveries require 21 and over signature, but yet we go to the extreme.  Compounded with the internal USPS issues this law certainly didn't help them and neither will further regulation on tobacco. This law also put many small businesses out of business. Is this what America was founded on? I'm just one small business that employees 30 full time workers.

I work with all 11 Wisconsin Tribes to improve the quality of life for tribal members. Our coalition has a leader in each tribe who educates, advocates, and develops programs and policies about commercial tobacco in order to protect all who live, work, and play on the reservations. We also educate on the traditional uses of tobacco. There is a high prevalence of commercial tobacco abuse on Wisconsin reservations. The smoking rate for Native Americans in Wisconsin is 34% compared to the Wisconsin average smoking rate of 21% (please see attached reference, It’s Still an Uphill Battle). In my community, I have observed that a majority of smokers prefer Newport, a menthol product, and Marlboro. The Wisconsin Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2009-2010) dataset shows that 53.86% of Wisconsin Native American smokers surveyed currently do smoke or have smoked menthol cigarettes. Some Native American tribes believe in sacred tobacco as a medicine. This is very different from commercial tobacco use. When not abused, sacred tobacco can help with ceremonies, obtaining native names, and obtaining information from elders. In contrast, commercial tobacco appropriates Native American imagery to deceptively market “natural” menthol cigarettes. Menthol tobacco is one issue in the larger struggle with commercial tobacco abuse and its effect on Native Americans and those on tribal land in Wisconsin. Another is that there is no protection from cigarette and tobacco product use in indoor work and public places on tribal land. Commercial tobacco should not be allowed, especially indoors, or have additives in it to “hook” or “target” anybody."

I can not iterate this enough that we were NOT put here to abuse, torture &/or kill ANYTHING & animals were NOT put here for us humans to do despicable & gruesome acts upon!   The pain & suffering we humans are causing animals is disgraceful, appalling, atrocious & barbaric & is totally unnecessary! It is astounding that humans are so unbelievably cruel and evil.There is this saying ... treat others like you would want to be treated.  Again, we humans were not born into this world to be evil (or nice), it is a CHOICE, a CONSCIOUS CHOICE!  All humans have a choice to help or to hurt.  I have to apologize but I am VERY passionate about animals & what humans are doing to them & I have no respect what so ever for anyone that harms animals.   I can't do a gosh darn thing but use my mouth & write about what’s happening to animals all over the world every single day; the abuse, pain & suffering animals are going through at the hands of humans … BUT YOU CAN, YOU HAVE THE POWER and I am reaching out to you, I am begging you for your help and support.

2296,FDA-2013-N-0521-0394,"The Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund urges the FDA to act immediately to remove menthol cigarettes from the marketplace.Mitchell Zeller, J.D.Director, Center for Tobacco ProductsFood and Drug Administration9200 Corporate BoulevardRockville, MD 20850November 18, 2013RE: Docket No. FDA-2013-N-0521—Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Menthol in Cigarettes, Tobacco Products; Request for Comments. We write today to urge the FDA to remove menthol cigarettes from the market as quickly as possible.Tobacco use is responsible for more than 400,000 deaths each year in the United States and is the leading preventable cause of death. A quarter of all cigarettes sold are menthol cigarettes, which studies show are preferred by younger smokers and new smokers. Since almost 9 out of 10 (88%) adult smokers began smoking before age 18, it will save lives to make smoking as unappealing as possible for teenagers and young adults. Menthol’s “cooling effect” does the opposite: it makes smoking as palatable (perhaps more palatable) to young people and nonsmokers as candy flavoring, which was banned in 2009 under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. According to the FDA’s Preliminary Scientific Evaluation of the Possible Public Health Effects of Menthol Versus Nonmenthol Cigarettes, “the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with increased initiation and progression to regular of cigarette smoking.” Not only are menthol cigarettes a starter product for youth, they are harder to quit because they are likely associated with: 1) “increased dependence,” and 2) “reduced success in smoking cessation, especially among African American menthol smokers.”  For these reasons, we strongly agree with the FDA conclusions that “menthol cigarettes pose a public health risk above that seen with nonmenthol cigarettes.” The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC), before which we testified, concluded over two years ago that “removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the United States.” A conservative modeling scenario published in a peer-reviewed medical journal estimated that over 320,000 deaths—most of them among African Americans—could be averted by 2050 had menthol been banned in 2011 as recommended.(1)   The FDA must not drag its feet any longer. The decision to extend the comment period an additional two months itself cost thousands of lives. The Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund represents the millions of American families whose lives have been touched by cancer, and our mission is to gather and scrutinize research to determine how programs and policies can reduce the incidence of cancer and improve treatment options for cancer patients.  Our scientific analysis indicates that hundreds of thousands of lives will be saved when the FDA removes menthol cigarettes from the market, and we strongly urge the FDA to protect the public health by implementing a final rule to do so.Sincerely,Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund(1) Levy, et. al., Modeling the future effects of a menthol ban on reduced smoking prevalence and deaths averted in the United States.

This will indefinitely lead to a rise in foot traffic towards face-to-face transactions where minors can easily get there tobacco by simply asking someone to buy it for them, ultimately leading to a rise in underage tobacco consumption. The pact act already takes care of most potential problems of online distribution by asking for a signature of confirmation upon delivery of products.

The black marketing and contraband activity in tobacco is well documented, and counterfeit cigarettes are smuggled into the country today. Reports we’ve seen indicate that it is fertile ground for organized crime, and that is just something we do not need.Our retailers are used to good, healthy competition. We see it in their advertising and marketing every day as they vie for customers. But a ban on menthol cigarettes would hit retailers hard, and consequently hurt wholesalers and their employees, as well.Further, we have looked at the fiscal impact the elimination of these kinds of cigarettes and tobacco products would have on our state budgets. Generally, retail works on thin margins but if a product is taken out of the marketplace those margins and the attendant tax revenue will be further reduced. Just as retail is rebounding from the recent tough economic times we experienced, neither our members nor our state budget can afford another serious hit.We would, therefore, urge you to move very methodically through this process. We understand very clearly your mandate at the FDA as directed by Congress but we believe it important to take into consideration the impacts your decisions could have in America’s marketplace.Best regards,Rick Brown President"

The tobacco corporations will seek to exploit this loophole, just as they are trying to get governments around the world to ignore their obligations under the FCTC.I urge you to resist and bring to light any attempts by the tobacco industry to undermine FDA regulation.

A funding source from a national and state tobacco tax (on all products) should be provided for strict enforcement of local, state and national smoking laws as well as prevention and treatment of tobacco related diseases.  We should have a national regulation mandating smoke-free cars carrying children. It is extremely important to have an Advisory Committee that is independent of the tobacco industry and its affiliates. All nicotine products (including new ones) should be tested for health and safety and regulated BEFORE they enter the market. For those already on the market, they should be evaluated to see if they can be made less hazardous and addictive. Menthol and other additives should not be allowed in tobacco. All tobacco products should be treated and taxed equally. Nicotine levels should be systematically reduced to enable tobacco users to quit. Free NRT & support should be provided for those who want to quit. The tobacco industry (not the victims of tobacco addiction) should have to pay for treatment of tobacco related diseases and low birth weight babies to reduce the burden off the state and federal government.

This is 2012, not the dark ages. There is absolutely no justification for animal testing. Animals cannot speak for or defend themselves from these invasive experiments. Therefore these tests are unethical. Furthermore animal tests are bad science on the most basic level as each species has variations in their biologies making a conclusion on one species dangerous to assume about another.

In Indiana, of middle school students who are current smokers, 47 percent of African American middle school students and 46 percent of Hispanic middle school students smoke menthol cigarettes. Among current middle school smokers who are white, 39 percent smoke menthol cigarettes. Of high school students who are current smokers, 63 percent of African American, 50 percent of Hispanic and 49 percent of white high school students smoke menthol cigarettes. More than one third of Indiana adult smokers (36 percent) usually smoke menthol cigarettes. Four out of five (80 percent) of non-white Indiana adult smokers usually smoke menthol cigarettes. Among adult African Americans who smoke, 90 percent usually smoke menthol cigarettes. Approximately 29 percent of white smokers smoke menthol cigarettes. In Indiana, younger adults (aged between 18-44 years) are significantly more likely than older smokers (aged 45 and above) to smoke menthol cigarettes. While nearly 50 percent of younger smokers usually smoke menthol cigarettes, only approximately 20 percent of older smokers smoke menthols.Menthol cigarettes are highly marketed to African Americans and people of color in Indiana and throughout the United States. Due to the high proportion of smokers that smoke menthol cigarettes, removing menthol flavoring from cigarettes could help in reducing smoking in our state.

Each new restriction was met with fierce opposition.  Tobacco control is not an issue of revenue, enforcement or government interference; it is a public health issue.  In public health, we don't do what is easy or expedient, we do what is right.Many children become addicted to nicotine by smoking menthol cigarettes.  Menthol masks the harshness of those first sickening puffs, allowing them to forge on to the next cigarette and then the next. Once addicted, they will use any form of nicotine available.  Were it not for the soothing effects of menthol, the first excruciating attempts at smoking cigarettes may be painful enough to stop a child from further experimentation and eventual addiction. The health of our children must always be our primary consideration.  All other considerations, whether driven by greed or lack of knowledge must be ignored.Every new tobacco control regulation is met with the prediction of doom, the collapse of the economy and life as we know it.
